21/05/2015, 19:56:09: Rich: You could report him for bodging the numbers
21/05/2015, 19:56:17: Rich: If you were feeling really vindictive

21/05/2015, 19:57:47: Rich: Ha just completely fuck it up
21/05/2015, 19:58:09: Rich: Draw dicks on it
21/05/2015, 19:58:18: Alex Brown: I could 'accidentally' put a lower size on the rebar for a huge concrete slab around the columns
21/05/2015, 19:58:26: Alex Brown: Not leading to collapse
21/05/2015, 19:58:46: Rich: Just waste of money making the wrong parts?
21/05/2015, 19:58:50: Alex Brown: But would make the whole slab crack aroud all of the 20 columns
21/05/2015, 19:59:12: Alex Brown: Making the entire building completely unusable
21/05/2015, 19:59:18: Alex Brown: But not dangerous
21/05/2015, 19:59:31: Alex Brown: I have very much the power to do that
21/05/2015, 19:59:53: Alex Brown: Because of their own short comings
21/05/2015, 20:00:32: Rich: Yeah you probably shouldn't risk people lives
21/05/2015, 20:00:43: Alex Brown: It wouldnt
21/05/2015, 20:00:56: Alex Brown: It would just crack after drying
21/05/2015, 20:01:08: Alex Brown: Not result in structural collapse
21/05/2015, 20:01:45: Alex Brown: I can riddle this building im doing now with poor designs
21/05/2015, 20:02:03: Alex Brown: But make sure its safe
21/05/2015, 20:02:33: Alex Brown: All trains are cancelled this weekend
21/05/2015, 20:02:50: Alex Brown: Im kind of like your saviour guys

21/05/2015, 20:03:12: Alex Brown: I really am

15/09/2015, 13:14:54: Alex Brown: No its ok hes leaving for a week
15/09/2015, 13:15:02: Rich: It's just so we can inhumanely torture it to death
15/09/2015, 13:15:23: Alex Brown: But i suppose poison would be more final than a weeks rest
15/09/2015, 13:16:05: sil: Put poison in the humane traps
15/09/2015, 14:26:51: sil: Can't believe Alex took a day of work when he's not even ill.
15/09/2015, 14:27:05: sil: It's people like you that ruin our economy

15/09/2015, 14:34:06: Rich: They do. Alex is the embodiment of the deficit
15/09/2015, 14:51:44: sil: Rich is Alex genuinely ill?
15/09/2015, 14:52:07: Alex Brown: Why would you ask rich
15/09/2015, 14:52:22: Alex Brown: He doesnt know how ill i am

15/09/2015, 14:54:22: Rich: Just being a lazy fatty
15/09/2015, 14:54:33: Alex Brown: Rich im not fat
15/09/2015, 14:54:44: Alex Brown: I think youll find im hench
15/09/2015, 14:55:03: Alex Brown: Rich was listening to lame rock earlier
15/09/2015, 14:55:15: Alex Brown: He was trying to hide it from us
15/09/2015, 14:55:28: Alex Brown: I bust him
15/09/2015, 14:58:48: Rich: It was God speed you black emperor, which is post rock and it's fine
15/09/2015, 14:59:14: Rich: Not very discerning ears have we alex?
15/09/2015, 14:59:55: Rich: Of course I wouldn't expect any better from a man who dislikes jazz and only listened to hip hop ever before we enlightened him
15/09/2015, 15:01:30: Alex Brown: Cute
15/09/2015, 15:02:00: Alex Brown: Rich is trying to explain himself out of it
15/09/2015, 15:02:43: sil: God speed you black emperor is fine Alex.
15/09/2015, 15:03:05: Alex Brown: Cute
15/09/2015, 15:04:28: sil: It's very expressive music. I understand that the emotion within the music might be hard for you to understand
15/09/2015, 15:06:22: ‎You changed the subject to “Alex has no taste 👍🏼”
15/09/2015, 15:06:32: sil: Can you understand how a happy song would make a person feel?
15/09/2015, 15:06:50: Alex Brown: Cute the lot of you
15/09/2015, 15:07:13: Alex Brown: Rich is the one with human autism
15/09/2015, 15:07:37: sil: You have music and animal autism
15/09/2015, 15:10:35: sil: Also your work autistic. I bet your colleagues have to pick up so much of your slack today while you pretend to be ill without a care in the world
15/09/2015, 15:11:40: Rich: Bastard
15/09/2015, 15:11:57: sil: Poor little Jimmy probably has to grade the strength of your planned concrete installation all by himself
15/09/2015, 15:12:42: Alex Brown: That sentence was remarkably accurate
15/09/2015, 15:13:03: Alex Brown: Except it was overly arty
15/09/2015, 15:13:10: sil: I just put a bunch of boring sounding things together. I knew it'd sound accurate
15/09/2015, 15:13:20: Alex Brown: Cute
15/09/2015, 15:14:07: Rich: You forgot to mention cantilevers
15/09/2015, 15:18:20: Alex Brown: Read the opening sentence of this guys module lol
15/09/2015, 15:18:24: Alex Brown: We are all project managers. Speaking personally, I have a working wife and two sons and every day is a project management exercise - fortunately I have attended my own lectures so it is straightforward for me.
15/09/2015, 15:18:36: Alex Brown: Cute.
15/09/2015, 15:20:09: sil: You could take a tip from this guy. Start project managing leaving the house on time
15/09/2015, 15:20:25: Alex Brown: How cute
15/09/2015, 15:20:32: Alex Brown: Shouldnt you be working

20/09/2015, 13:39:47: Rich: I was kayaking the other day and thought it would make a great adventure medium
20/09/2015, 13:40:23: Alex Brown: Can we take the cat?
20/09/2015, 13:40:47: sil: Alex, check with your care worker first
20/09/2015, 13:41:37: Rich: Thanks for babysitting dan. I'll slip you a £10 when I get home
20/09/2015, 13:42:20: sil: It's ok. Sorry that I let him stay up a bit late. He was acting up a bit

02/10/2015, 17:25:51: Rich: Pub this evening?
02/10/2015, 18:50:06: sil: Im going to Sussex
11/10/2015, 15:58:39: sil: Shall we think about booking flights for New Years soon?
11/10/2015, 15:58:47: sil: While it still might be cheap
11/10/2015, 16:11:09: Rich: Yeah we should
11/10/2015, 16:11:31: Rich: Could also go by ferry
14/10/2015, 08:04:31: Rich: <‎image omitted>
14/10/2015, 08:22:41: sil: Nice! What trap is that? Just looks like a block has fallen and crushed it
14/10/2015, 08:39:48: Rich: Regular mouse trap. After the initial elation I was overcome with guilt. I think it flipped up as it closed
14/10/2015, 08:42:50: sil: Just remember he shit in ur bed rich
14/10/2015, 10:36:18: Rich: Well he's dead now. I wonder if we'll see more or if they'll get the message
14/10/2015, 10:36:34: Rich: Maybe we should display his head on a cocktail stick
14/10/2015, 13:48:33: Alex Brown: Nice! Very comical, love <3
14/10/2015, 15:35:19: sil: It's probably the same mouse I saw run across ur kitchen yesterday
14/10/2015, 15:35:35: sil: I could have witnessed that mouses final moments
14/10/2015, 15:36:44: Rich: I feel like we would have heard it
15/10/2015, 08:05:15: Rich: <‎image omitted>
15/10/2015, 08:05:15: Rich: <‎image omitted>
15/10/2015, 08:07:53: Rich: That second one is a baby. Which is sad, but also means that there was a litter recently...
15/10/2015, 08:27:44: sil: Great work rich. Future generations of mice will hear your name and tremble with fear. Every litter across this land will remember the great genocide of 2015, and feel the burden of there settlement. You have cleansed this generation of the weak, made room for our most glorious people to flourish. All hail rich the killer, the most just and noble tyrant of flat 3
15/10/2015, 09:02:52: Rich: :(
15/10/2015, 09:03:00: Rich: I think one was definitely a child
15/10/2015, 09:03:17: Rich: The other was fat and only got caught on the side
15/10/2015, 09:03:23: Rich: So I expect it died quite slowly
15/10/2015, 09:03:38: sil: They say our leader was born atop a mountain of invader skulls. A mountain he crafted himself after slaying the hordes of rodents that sook to inhabit these great walls and corrode the foundations of our most prosperous and glorious nation. How he managed to build this mountain of such magnificence before his birth is unknown. But it is no matter of doubt. He is a just and wise leader, and marches his people, who bestow to him undying gratitude and awe, towards our global supremacy in the face of the invader colonialists. We know he stops at nothing and feels no weakness or shame when he slays the children of our most hated enemy. Long live rich the killer
15/10/2015, 09:09:04: Rich: May the rodents ever tremble
15/10/2015, 09:53:53: sil: Martin Creedy, the blacksmith from the village is missing this morning. The last I saw of him was at yesterday's demonstration. It's hard to acknowledge the awful truth of the situation. I fear we will never see him again. What a fool. A kind and generous man, but a fool non the less. Our leader said our greatest threat was our rodent invader enemy, and I believe him to be honest and just, but its hard to ignore that we are living in tumultuous times. The rally yesterday was 100 strong, I have no idea who still stands solid behind there beliefs this morning. Our leader has a great plan, he is doing the work which destiny has dictated to him. I know I must be patient for the great fulfilment of his prophecy. But yet somehow, I fear. How many more must we lose on the road to a pure society? I by no means question our leaders motives, but it's hard to watch our comrades numbers dwindle.
15/10/2015, 09:55:06: Rich: The weak must go
15/10/2015, 09:55:31: Rich: Like the great Spartans we will achieve strength through purity
15/10/2015, 13:14:32: sil: It's been 3 weeks since the counter purge started. RGH news captured footage of a successful campaign against the vermin on the east river. '100 dead' the report claims. Our captain general surveys the scene with a smile of great excellence. The heads of mice snapped off in machines of barbaric entrapment, in countless piles. The sight makes me feel Squeamish at first, but I am reminded by the anchor of the missing village folk and there fate at the hands of the mice invader. After the disappearance there were whispers from those who placed blame on our supreme and gracious leader. They soon realised the true enemy after they too succumbed to the dastardly deeds of the rodents. I never once doubted our leader, I know he is kind, I know he is righteous. I know now for sure, like we are reminded, that it's the rodent vermin that rots our society at the core. Tonight we gather in Hayes square to give thanks to all our leader has provided, and the shelter that he defends. May the war continue, may our enemy's be crushed and the memory's of our comrades revenged
15/10/2015, 16:51:05: sil: I was gonna continue this story for another 2 chapters. But now I can't be bothered
15/10/2015, 16:51:18: sil: Nice catch rich

04/05/2016, 14:01:28: Rich: To be honest I don't care and I supposed that's what had happened
04/05/2016, 14:02:29: sil: Yeah I just saw loads of articles featuring the actor saying stuff like "can't believe he lied to us"
04/05/2016, 14:03:05: Rich: So did he claim he was done with got to throw them off the scent?
04/05/2016, 14:03:43: sil: I guess so. Probably did interviews saying how he'll miss it
04/05/2016, 14:04:23: Rich: I think him and another character are supposed to come back from the dead in the books
04/05/2016, 14:04:32: Rich: But in the show they didn't bother with the other character

22/05/2016, 15:00:34: sil: And there's a good length on the Shropshire Union canal
22/05/2016, 15:00:40: Rich: Yeah that'd be cool

22/05/2016, 15:13:39: Rich: Was considering starting in new town to add some more distance
22/05/2016, 15:13:49: sil: That's where I calculated from

22/05/2016, 15:14:13: Rich: Oh cool
22/05/2016, 15:14:31: Rich: How far was the last trip?
22/05/2016, 15:14:43: sil: Alex has that data
22/05/2016, 15:17:37: sil: If we really push we could make it to Liverpool
22/05/2016, 15:17:43: sil: It's just a bit beyond
22/05/2016, 15:17:52: Alex Brown: 59.8 miles
22/05/2016, 15:18:22: sil: Liverpool would be 18 miles extra
22/05/2016, 15:19:32: Alex Brown: Cant do it I must return to london

24/05/2016, 11:06:27: sil: Oh rich, could you bring a few of your tent pegs on the ride?

24/05/2016, 11:39:34: Rich: Sure
24/05/2016, 11:39:43: Rich: Remind me like Thursday when I'm packing
24/05/2016, 11:39:59: Rich: I may leave packed panniers if you don't mind taking them in your car
24/05/2016, 11:40:35: sil: That's fine. Can you take your bike apart too. Front and back wheels off
24/05/2016, 11:41:10: Rich: Will do. Careful with the bikes in the car. I messed my gears up on the canal boat roof
24/05/2016, 11:41:36: sil: We will try and position them best we can
24/05/2016, 11:42:06: Rich: Yeah I guess it's just making sure the gears don't rest on anything. Should be easy with the seats down
24/05/2016, 13:29:43: Alex Brown: Rich pls dont forget my bike
24/05/2016, 13:30:15: Alex Brown: He said come in some time after we went in yesterday

24/05/2016, 13:41:39: Alex Brown: I swear I saw pound signs in his eyes
24/05/2016, 13:58:49: Rich: I doubt it will be. He'd call you if it was going to cost more. I've been there a lot and I trust them completely.
24/05/2016, 14:18:35: sil: Are they gonna put a motor on your bike Alex, so you can keep up with us?
24/05/2016, 14:18:37: sil: Banter
24/05/2016, 14:32:54: Rich: Lolol batelicious
24/05/2016, 14:33:01: Rich: Bantelicious
24/05/2016, 14:33:31: Rich: The guy told Alex he'd need a different chain for the wheels he's having put on else it would slip loads
24/05/2016, 14:33:46: Rich: Alex refused and I had to talk him into getting it
24/05/2016, 14:37:52: sil: If I have to stop every 10 mins for Alex to put his chain on, I would be annoyed
24/05/2016, 14:38:29: Rich: Yup
24/05/2016, 15:06:03: Alex Brown: As long as theyve never had ure pants over your head
24/05/2016, 15:06:30: sil: Wut?
24/05/2016, 15:06:51: Rich: He's implying that I'd be unaware of them overcharging me
24/05/2016, 15:10:23: sil: I never thought Alex was scared of overspending. His car is evidence of that
24/05/2016, 15:10:29: sil: Banter
24/05/2016, 15:11:31: Rich: Ha top bants

24/05/2016, 16:57:59: Alex Brown: Expensive chain that
24/05/2016, 16:58:19: Rich: It was £20. Not exactly the end of the world
24/05/2016, 16:58:21: Alex Brown: So he hasnt fixed my bent main gears which are the problem?
24/05/2016, 16:58:30: Alex Brown: This man

27/05/2016, 11:31:04: Rich: All my shit is ready
27/05/2016, 11:31:35: Rich: Please be careful with the back gear/derailleur as they are pretty protruding
27/05/2016, 11:32:24: sil: Think cable ties could be useful for fastening things to bikes
27/05/2016, 11:33:10: Rich: Yeah for sure
27/05/2016, 11:33:22: Rich: Bungee is probably best for the tent

24/06/2016, 14:28:30: Rich: That's true. But we'll lose time in Wales. If we leave tomorrow we won't get there until early evening and then we'll have to turn round and come back less than 24 hours after arriving
24/06/2016, 14:29:17: sil: I envision we leave 10am, head straight to Wales. We will be there 2pm?

24/06/2016, 14:31:10: Rich: So it would have been nice to break it up in one direction
24/06/2016, 14:31:15: sil: If we go Alexs we will have to wait for Alex to do stuff and his parents

24/06/2016, 15:24:58: sil: Alex would you be willing to drive?
24/06/2016, 16:04:30: sil: I wonder if Greg actually voted
24/06/2016, 16:04:36: sil: He's been very vocal today
24/06/2016, 16:22:30: Rich: I saw his comment this morning and it irritates me a little bit. Thought it ironically applicable as a reason for leaving the du
24/06/2016, 16:22:34: Rich: Eu
24/06/2016, 16:23:18: sil: I bet he didn't vote
24/06/2016, 16:23:25: sil: He could have applied for postal
24/06/2016, 16:23:46: Rich: I think as he's technically an ex pat he wasn't able to vote
24/06/2016, 16:24:03: sil: I think he is
24/06/2016, 16:24:09: sil: Surely
24/06/2016, 16:28:03: Rich: I can't remember the exact rules but if people were living elsewhere in Europe then they weren't allowed to vote

01/07/2016, 09:37:47: sil: Always wondered how he did as much exercise as he claims and managed to stay so amazingly fit
01/07/2016, 09:37:54: Rich: Yeah it makes Seanad
01/07/2016, 09:37:56: Rich: Sense

10/07/2016, 22:56:58: sil: End of mountain trails, or areas which have little footfall. Could use data for places where people hardly reach
10/07/2016, 22:57:31: Rich: Yeah I hope that's where they are. I guess they need to be careful that people don't endanger themselves

18/08/2016, 21:57:33: Alex Brown: Nah man
18/08/2016, 21:57:49: sil: But we'd have to lie and learn the stuff online. That's what rich and his friends did
18/08/2016, 21:58:05: Alex Brown: Dont trust our knot tying
18/08/2016, 21:58:21: Alex Brown: Broken legs sound awful

01/09/2016, 10:41:38: Rich: Maybe it was just announced?
01/09/2016, 10:42:29: sil: Yeah I guess so. It'll be a pretty big exhibition, the Bowie one was huge, so guess it's big enough new to justify doing a piece on the announcement
01/09/2016, 10:42:54: Rich: Mm
01/09/2016, 18:31:33: sil: Did you know India pale ale is called so, not because it was traditionally brewed in India, but because it was brewed in England to ship over to English trooped station there because the local alcohol was so bad. And the reason it's stronger than usual ale is because the strength helps the beer remain quality during the long journey across the ocean
01/09/2016, 18:35:28: Alex Brown: I knew the second one but not the first
01/09/2016, 18:35:38: Alex Brown: Makes sense

03/09/2016, 11:37:24: sil: Architects are interesting and creative
03/09/2016, 11:38:01: Alex Brown: Cute that every working architect is taught to be a planning and conceptual architect
03/09/2016, 11:38:23: Rich: Engineers are just calculators for the architects
03/09/2016, 11:38:22: Alex Brown: The vast majority of architecture is boring as fuck
03/09/2016, 11:38:49: sil: Thats basically true. A computer can do an engineers job

03/09/2016, 11:40:58: Alex Brown: Cute

03/09/2016, 11:41:46: Alex Brown: Go a little yeehaa and span floors the wrong way
03/09/2016, 11:42:13: sil: Engineers will be terminated
03/09/2016, 11:43:39: Rich: People like me will slowly eliminate jobs from your industry
03/09/2016, 11:44:40: sil: Yep. Rich is a puppet master for the rising computer overlords

Routine
06/01/2017, 19:19:04: Rich: Apparently there are more pubs in London than the brownswood and faltering fullback

07/01/2017, 15:50:17: Rich: I did tell her, but she told me something different and had invited people
07/01/2017, 15:50:29: Rich: She's in charge
07/01/2017, 15:50:53: sil: That's fair enough. Wish you said before I told other people though

13/01/2017, 19:34:37: Rich: Would be pretty easy
13/01/2017, 19:38:44: Rich: It might be nicer to get the train to the south of London and cycle out through Sussex
13/01/2017, 19:39:24: Alex Brown: I feel it would be nice to see the city dwidle behind us
13/01/2017, 19:39:33: Alex Brown: Pretenciuos as fuck
13/01/2017, 19:39:38: Alex Brown: But true
13/01/2017, 19:39:45: Rich: The problem going north is that it would scarcely dwindle
13/01/2017, 19:40:09: Rich: Like, we want to find somewhere that is pretty and sparse
13/01/2017, 19:40:15: Alex Brown: There are alot of nice canals between here and stanstead
13/01/2017, 19:40:17: Rich: It would be cool to see London Rd

13/01/2017, 19:40:52: Alex Brown: We can start in walthamstow
13/01/2017, 19:40:58: Alex Brown: Ye exactly

13/01/2017, 19:42:34: Rich: 90 miles to harwick taking the scenic route

15/01/2017, 20:41:18: Alex Brown: So I never have to get up again
15/01/2017, 20:46:39: Rich: Think of all the games you'll be able to play that you couldn't have already played on a ps4...
15/01/2017, 20:48:03: sil: I still don't understand why you've bought an xbox
15/01/2017, 20:49:36: sil: Are you just making a collection of expensive things you never use?
15/01/2017, 20:50:44: sil: Is it an art piece?
Are you making a living statement about consumerism?
Highlighting the absurdity of capitalist culture through obtaining artifacts that will never be used?
15/01/2017, 20:51:08: Rich: Genius
15/01/2017, 20:52:05: Alex Brown: I cant play halo gears of war and rare classics on ps4
15/01/2017, 20:52:07: sil: Having a ps4 and xbox is kinda like having an acoustic and an electric guitar, and not using either.
15/01/2017, 20:52:14: Alex Brown: As well as many others
15/01/2017, 20:52:51: Alex Brown: You are just upset because I have far superior bants

17/02/2017, 11:53:11: sil: Must be*
17/02/2017, 11:53:51: sil: Very inferior to MY immune system
17/02/2017, 11:58:18: sil: Sure you don't have AIDS??
17/02/2017, 12:01:31: sil: Just kidding mate. It's banter after all. Mates telling mates they got aids
17/02/2017, 12:02:07: Rich: That's racist
17/02/2017, 12:02:06: sil: Although your sex history does put you in the high risk group
17/02/2017, 12:02:15: Rich: But true
17/02/2017, 17:05:52: sil: Alex me and Adam going to snooty fox around 7. 
Rich why don't you pop by first before Dalston?
17/02/2017, 17:06:31: sil: Actually maybe that's illogical from your location
17/02/2017, 17:08:12: sil: We're probs not going to be there super late or anything
17/02/2017, 17:12:15: Rich: Hmm will see later
17/02/2017, 17:12:20: Rich: Think I'm going to eat here
17/02/2017, 17:12:34: Rich: I may be able to get people to come to that pub as its not far
17/02/2017, 17:12:42: Rich: But I'm going to see what their plan is first
17/02/2017, 17:13:21: sil: Cool. Well I'll be there from 7. I'll probably eat there.
17/02/2017, 17:17:04: Rich: Cool
17/02/2017, 19:26:01: sil: What you thinking?
17/02/2017, 19:26:06: sil: Richard?
17/02/2017, 19:46:28: sil: That's Richard wasn't me just being a nuisance. I was just ensuring you knew I was addressing you
17/02/2017, 20:15:13: Rich: Ha sorry
17/02/2017, 20:15:27: Rich: Not left home so going straight to theirs
17/02/2017, 20:15:46: Rich: I'll let you know the plan when I'm there but can't promise anything
17/02/2017, 20:23:16: sil: How have you not just asked jam what his plan is?
Planning 101
17/02/2017, 20:25:25: sil: Communication is key
17/02/2017, 20:28:17: sil: Does he's not have a phone?
17/02/2017, 20:32:48: Rich: There's a whole group coordination aspect
17/02/2017, 20:33:09: sil: And non of them can tell you the plan?
17/02/2017, 20:33:24: Rich: I don't have all of their phone numbers nor the necessary social influence to guarantee I can make them all go to a specific pub
17/02/2017, 20:33:59: sil: But you could ask jam what his plan is and where he is going
17/02/2017, 20:52:50: sil: Then you'd know how solidified their plan was.
Then you could give me a definite no
17/02/2017, 21:03:15: Rich: It sounds like the plan may be just to drink at their place
17/02/2017, 21:16:06: sil: Alex, Adam said you took him to a super faggy hipster lamewad restaurant last week
17/02/2017, 21:22:06: Alex Brown: Not really it was an american style ribs place
17/02/2017, 21:22:45: Alex Brown: He insisted we go to a gay wad bar after that sold greenman bottles from a fridge
17/02/2017, 21:23:09: Alex Brown: I took him to a place that did noce chicken wings and blue cheese sauce
17/02/2017, 21:23:18: Alex Brown: Which sounds gayer
17/02/2017, 21:26:32: sil: He said it was overly hipster and you wanted to go home as soon as your girlfriend turned up
17/02/2017, 21:35:28: sil: He says your not very top lad
17/02/2017, 21:40:08: Alex Brown: I wanted to go before that
18/02/2017, 17:14:02: sil: What you doing 8ish?
Could pop buy on way home. Got your gin chocolate in back of my car
18/02/2017, 17:26:03: Alex Brown: Yeh go for it
18/02/2017, 17:26:20: Alex Brown: Was planning on seeing train spotting at some point tonight
18/02/2017, 17:26:40: sil: I saw it last week. It's pretty good
18/02/2017, 17:26:49: Alex Brown: Yeh wanna see it
18/02/2017, 17:27:16: sil: I'll let you know when we're leaving here
18/02/2017, 18:33:01: Alex Brown: Not there at the moment at east london liquor company
18/02/2017, 18:33:06: Alex Brown: With rich

18/02/2017, 20:41:41: Alex Brown: I know
18/02/2017, 20:41:47: Alex Brown: Very cute
18/02/2017, 20:41:49: sil: Disgusting druggy. Literally I spend my taxes and it goes to druggys
18/02/2017, 20:42:05: Alex Brown: I know
18/02/2017, 20:42:09: Alex Brown: Why even work
18/02/2017, 20:42:24: sil: Really gross. Drugs are ILLEGAL
18/02/2017, 20:42:27: Alex Brown: If its all going to pay for rich's NHS bill
18/02/2017, 20:42:39: Alex Brown: Scum
18/02/2017, 20:42:52: Alex Brown: Human garbage
18/02/2017, 20:42:53: sil: Did he not even realise being a druggy is ILLEGAL.
18/02/2017, 20:43:12: sil: Rich you smoking WEED as well?

18/02/2017, 20:46:43: sil: It's actually kind of pathetic. Our lads died for freedom in ww2. And druggys waste it on getting addicted to weed and mcat
18/02/2017, 21:23:32: sil: Rich don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight until I say something. So listen up. Really concerned your hooked on drugs mate. Your heading down a path you don't need to go down. It's a dark path, paved by hard working lads taxes. Your doing gateway drugs and it will lead to overdoses Which might kill you. Anyway, I just want you to know that we're all worried about you. You don't need to be a disgusting  pikey. We just want our lad back
18/02/2017, 23:28:54: Alex Brown: Oo god yeh

18/02/2017, 23:29:47: Alex Brown: Sickening
18/02/2017, 23:30:22: Alex Brown: Moght blown his body up near a chu
18/02/2017, 23:30:24: sil: Alex called me up crying earlier mate. Says you hardly seemed like yourself. It's upsetting. We just want our old mate back. Not the druggy scrounger benefit scum you've become
18/02/2017, 23:30:39: Rich: M8 mkat is fukin cool
18/02/2017, 23:30:39: sil: Your hurting your friends

18/02/2017, 23:31:33: Rich: It's well good
18/02/2017, 23:31:42: Rich: Full of mkat mate
18/02/2017, 23:32:29: Alex Brown: When rich called me up and said, "I took MCAT last night" I immediately thought pleb....

19/02/2017, 09:53:00: sil: I thought it was entertaining
19/02/2017, 09:53:15: sil: Music was bad though
19/02/2017, 10:16:27: Rich: That's a shame
19/02/2017, 14:59:30: sil: You had a come down yet rich?
19/02/2017, 15:00:17: Rich: I was too busy being drunk yesterday to really notice the comedown
19/02/2017, 15:00:24: Rich: I was very slow this morning though
19/02/2017, 15:00:35: sil: Sad
19/02/2017, 15:00:48: sil: What you've become
19/02/2017, 15:01:02: Rich: You've changed man
19/02/2017, 15:01:08: Rich: You used to be cool
19/02/2017, 15:01:19: Rich: Don't you remember when we used to trip on cannabis?
19/02/2017, 15:01:21: sil: Sounds like you'd relate to trainspotting
19/02/2017, 15:02:21: sil: They do lots of drugs and drinking
19/02/2017, 15:19:33: sil: To be fair I can't judge. Just had a coffee with 2 shots!
19/02/2017, 15:19:44: sil: Maybe I'm an addict. Lol
19/02/2017, 19:10:20: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>

28/02/2017, 20:27:44: Rich: I felt bad because I thought you might have gone straight from work or something

28/02/2017, 20:33:39: Alex Brown: Looks like a good route
28/02/2017, 20:34:52: Alex Brown: Gosfield
28/02/2017, 20:38:40: Rich: Nice
28/02/2017, 20:39:31: Rich: I wanna get to the coast
28/02/2017, 20:39:45: sil: How about we start in Shropshire guys
28/02/2017, 20:39:49: Rich: Trouble with London outskirts is it'll be hard to find good places to camp
28/02/2017, 20:40:10: sil: Yeah I agree. We should totally start in Shropshire
28/02/2017, 20:44:19: sil: Actually isn't your bike in Shropshire Alex?
28/02/2017, 20:48:02: Alex Brown: Id like to bring it here
28/02/2017, 20:48:23: Alex Brown: Weve gone from shropshire loads
28/02/2017, 20:48:35: Alex Brown: Borrow one off your dad for a week
28/02/2017, 20:49:10: Alex Brown: Call him in advance and ask to borrow it
28/02/2017, 20:49:30: sil: That'll be stupid
28/02/2017, 20:49:42: Alex Brown: Or get a proper bike
28/02/2017, 20:49:45: sil: Unless we go London to Shropshire
28/02/2017, 20:49:54: Alex Brown: Sell your foldable one you dont use
28/02/2017, 20:50:03: sil: Otherwise it's a lot of driving that voids cycling
28/02/2017, 20:50:11: sil: I use that all the time Alex
28/02/2017, 20:50:16: sil: I actually cycle
28/02/2017, 20:50:31: sil: Unless your fat lazy ass
28/02/2017, 20:50:35: Alex Brown: Sounds like pleb transport
28/02/2017, 20:50:37: sil: Unlike*
28/02/2017, 20:50:42: Alex Brown: I thought you drove
28/02/2017, 20:51:01: sil: I do
28/02/2017, 20:51:06: sil: I get out the house a lot
28/02/2017, 20:51:21: Alex Brown: Pleb transport
28/02/2017, 20:51:34: Alex Brown: I walk
28/02/2017, 20:51:42: Alex Brown: Because im hench
28/02/2017, 20:52:02: Alex Brown: Dont need some mad fangled contraption to get around
28/02/2017, 20:53:51: sil: is that why you don't leave a mile radius from either your work or house?
Get tired from the walking?
28/02/2017, 20:58:07: sil: If we go from London I could look into to borrowing someone's bike or renting one
28/02/2017, 20:59:50: sil: Rich does tash have a decent bike?
What's the chances I could borrow it of I put down a deposit or something?
28/02/2017, 21:08:47: Alex Brown: Tashs is small if its the same one as before
28/02/2017, 21:08:59: Alex Brown: My legs hit the bars
28/02/2017, 21:09:14: Alex Brown: James is bringing his down
28/02/2017, 21:21:36: sil: Renting a decent bike is like £75 for 3 days. Rip off
28/02/2017, 21:21:54: sil: I'm sure someone has a decent enough bike I could borrow
28/02/2017, 21:22:39: Alex Brown: Plus damages for tyre fuckage
28/02/2017, 21:22:43: Alex Brown: Thats a rip
28/02/2017, 21:22:54: Rich: Yeah Tash might let you borrow hers
28/02/2017, 21:22:55: Alex Brown: £75 alone aint too bad tho
28/02/2017, 21:23:03: Rich: You should go on your folksy
28/02/2017, 21:23:06: Alex Brown: Thats very reasonable
28/02/2017, 21:23:07: Rich: Foldy
28/02/2017, 21:23:11: Rich: It's not that bad
28/02/2017, 21:23:21: Alex Brown: That thing will die
28/02/2017, 21:23:24: Rich: Just because it's not a super duper mountain bike
28/02/2017, 21:23:29: sil: I could do. I would have to stick exclusively roads tho
28/02/2017, 21:23:29: Alex Brown: Off road
28/02/2017, 21:23:56: Alex Brown: Itll be slow
28/02/2017, 21:24:11: sil: Hasn't got proper front suspension, so wouldn't move on canal path l.
I'd be going the same pace as Alex which would suck
28/02/2017, 21:24:38: Rich: The canal path in round here is fine
28/02/2017, 21:24:44: sil: Depends what sort of tracks we recon we will do
28/02/2017, 21:24:47: Rich: I don't reallly want to do more canal path like last time
28/02/2017, 21:25:07: sil: But we're hoping to get out far aren't we?
Gonna be pretty lame if it's still urbanised like London
28/02/2017, 21:25:25: sil: Canal paths are good I think
28/02/2017, 21:25:48: sil: More Interesting than just going on roads
28/02/2017, 21:25:53: Alex Brown: Look up the lea and then out that way
28/02/2017, 21:25:55: sil: Last time we had good balance

10/03/2017, 21:06:02: Alex Brown: Anyone else?
10/03/2017, 21:06:39: Rich: Yes what a wonderful city with such fantastic night life opportunities
10/03/2017, 21:08:29: sil: must be pretty overwhelming to leave your flat for the first time in months

11/03/2017, 14:36:36: sil: sorry for the slow response btw guys. I meant to nay say at the time but was a bit busy. so I will naysay now.
11/03/2017, 14:37:35: sil: 1. Gloucester is a bad idea
11/03/2017, 14:38:09: sil: 2. staying at skells and not camping 2nd night is weak
11/03/2017, 14:40:45: sil: the great thing about about the cycling trip is leaving from a place we know and getting distance. getting a train to Gloucester and getting a train back is super lame and will lack achievement
11/03/2017, 14:41:10: sil: staying at skells 2nd night will be nice to see skell l, but camping is a big part of the trip
11/03/2017, 14:41:18: sil: last night would be cool
11/03/2017, 14:43:22: sil: we should start or end in London.  we should camp 3 nights
11/03/2017, 16:13:59: Alex Brown: I prefer Gloucester idea atm
11/03/2017, 16:14:37: Alex Brown: We looked at london last night and agreed its mostly main road routes
11/03/2017, 16:22:36: Rich: Yeah London routes look balls. It's much to densely populated
11/03/2017, 16:22:49: Rich: It's easy to get trains to and from the Gloucester route
11/03/2017, 16:22:53: Rich: It looks gorgeous
11/03/2017, 16:22:58: sil: hmm
11/03/2017, 16:23:03: Rich: And we'd be finishing what we started
11/03/2017, 16:23:18: sil: boring. we should do something new
11/03/2017, 16:23:25: Rich: We checked out a few ideas around London but it seems like we'd mainly be on busy roads
11/03/2017, 16:23:28: Rich: This would be new
11/03/2017, 16:23:40: Rich: We'd spend most of the trip on the side of the Severn estuary
11/03/2017, 16:23:46: Rich: Get to see it open into the sea
11/03/2017, 16:24:27: sil: I liked Alex's first plan. up towards  Norfolk. literally never been around there
11/03/2017, 16:25:58: sil: just gotta start early and do a long first day to get past city. then we're exploring uncharted country
11/03/2017, 16:27:04: sil: and we'll only need to get one train. it's the satisfaction of leaving from home. I don't like the idea of transporting our bikes a long distance them transporting them back. That's weak
11/03/2017, 16:35:34: Rich: We checked out the route. I feel like we'd be on busy roads a lot and it might be kind of dissapointing
11/03/2017, 16:35:46: Rich: Whereas the Severn estuary looks lovely
11/03/2017, 17:04:00: sil: boring. done that
11/03/2017, 17:04:04: sil: where yiu guys??
11/03/2017, 17:04:40: Rich: On a bus near by
11/03/2017, 17:04:42: Alex Brown: I actually agree with rich when look for routes on my plan it was mostly main roady
11/03/2017, 17:06:43: Alex Brown: And the brewery is 120 miles
11/03/2017, 17:06:47: Alex Brown: Too far
11/03/2017, 17:11:30: sil: yiu had a good plan alex
11/03/2017, 17:11:33: sil: good canal paths
11/03/2017, 18:39:09: Alex Brown: Im not sure about adnams its quite far and you have to go through ipswich
11/03/2017, 18:39:31: Alex Brown: Which I have no particular desire to visit
11/03/2017, 23:51:53: sil: I liked the idea of spending time near yeh coast and going a completely new route. we did the Severn. let's move onto something new
12/03/2017, 15:25:53: sil: <‎image omitted>
12/03/2017, 18:21:05: Alex Brown: Rofl wut is th@
12/03/2017, 18:21:30: Alex Brown: So what new are we going to move on to
12/03/2017, 18:21:50: Alex Brown: Gloucester is the current choice
12/03/2017, 18:22:31: Alex Brown: Suggest something else
12/03/2017, 18:23:06: sil: I think we should start in London. if we have to get a train somewhere that gonna take a big chunk out of our first day of cycling
12/03/2017, 18:23:33: sil: but I'm just one man, with one opinion
12/03/2017, 18:24:44: sil: I like the idea of going from London to the sea. the juxtaposition of big city to rural camping will feel like a great achievement. getting a train out to somewhere feels like cheating to me. Doesn't sound satisfying
12/03/2017, 18:26:04: sil: we've always started from a home base. That's part of the adventure.
12/03/2017, 18:29:30: sil: I think we should refine Alex's original idea.
go canal paths out east as long as possible. start early the first day we should be able to make it out rural. and the canal paths heading out of london will be well laid for a lot of miles
12/03/2017, 19:25:39: Rich: It sounds nice but the route had a lot of main roads
12/03/2017, 19:25:52: Rich: Anywhere in the Home Counties never really feels that rural
12/03/2017, 21:13:07: Rich: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs/on-demand/38275-015
12/03/2017, 21:17:33: sil: what grand designs are yu linking?
12/03/2017, 21:18:06: Rich: a couple try yo
12/03/2017, 21:18:20: Rich: to build a houseboat from recycled materials and bodge it horribly
12/03/2017, 21:54:06: Alex Brown: Did you just say juxtaposition?
12/03/2017, 21:56:09: sil: <‎image omitted>

12/03/2017, 21:58:17: Alex Brown: Cute
12/03/2017, 21:58:47: Alex Brown: My idea is refined
12/03/2017, 21:58:53: sil: <‎image omitted>
12/03/2017, 21:59:00: Alex Brown: And Im glad you agree
12/03/2017, 21:59:09: Alex Brown: I always have great ideas
12/03/2017, 21:59:30: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
12/03/2017, 22:03:52: sil: if we cycled to Rye in Sussex. Maybe I could get bryonys place for the final night for us?
12/03/2017, 22:04:19: sil: it's lovely countryside down there
12/03/2017, 22:04:35: Alex Brown: No been to rye
12/03/2017, 22:04:37: Alex Brown: Boring
12/03/2017, 22:04:52: Alex Brown: Thats not camping
12/03/2017, 22:05:07: Alex Brown: And too far
12/03/2017, 22:05:16: Alex Brown: South london sprawls
12/03/2017, 22:05:31: sil: I agree. I thought that was the weak direction you guys were thinking for those trip
12/03/2017, 22:06:05: Alex Brown: At least north east doesnt sprawl far
12/03/2017, 22:06:21: Alex Brown: Thats probably the best out of london route
12/03/2017, 22:06:50: Alex Brown: And richs house is optimum for it
12/03/2017, 22:06:57: sil: should give it a proper examination. true
12/03/2017, 22:07:16: sil: would easily be able to start and get stuff together at richs
12/03/2017, 22:07:18: Alex Brown: I liked jamess adnams suggestion
12/03/2017, 22:07:25: Alex Brown: But its too far
12/03/2017, 22:07:34: sil: how far is it?
12/03/2017, 22:07:43: Alex Brown: Like 120 miles
12/03/2017, 22:07:55: Alex Brown: Thats 30 a day for 4
12/03/2017, 22:08:02: Alex Brown: Which is taxing
12/03/2017, 22:08:19: Alex Brown: And thats on boring main roads
12/03/2017, 22:08:27: Alex Brown: Going through ipswich
12/03/2017, 22:08:33: sil: yeah too far
12/03/2017, 22:08:39: sil: how about margate?
12/03/2017, 22:08:46: sil: margate is meant to be really nice
12/03/2017, 22:08:51: sil: and it's on Sea
12/03/2017, 22:08:56: sil: 65miles
12/03/2017, 22:08:57: Alex Brown: Margate is pretty grim by the looks
12/03/2017, 22:09:02: sil: no its not
12/03/2017, 22:09:09: sil: it's fancyb
12/03/2017, 22:09:16: Alex Brown: And its the built up side of the thames
12/03/2017, 22:09:33: Alex Brown: I had a look on street view
12/03/2017, 22:09:44: Alex Brown: Didnt look as nice as chester
12/03/2017, 22:09:47: Alex Brown: Waa
12/03/2017, 22:09:51: Alex Brown: Was*
12/03/2017, 22:09:57: sil: http://www.kentonline.co.uk/thanet/news/kent-town-named-among-best-121925/
12/03/2017, 22:11:25: Rich: for margate either we get a train to the edge of london, which would make it a really short ride, or we spend ages cycling through lonodn
12/03/2017, 22:11:32: Rich: we'd be by the coast but it would never get that rural
12/03/2017, 22:11:32: sil: yiu can go via the Kent downs almost all the way there
12/03/2017, 22:11:53: sil: Kent downs
12/03/2017, 22:11:58: sil: all the way there
12/03/2017, 22:12:00: Rich: I'd be much happier getting properly out of london, where it won't be built up, there won't be busy roads and it will actually be nice
12/03/2017, 22:12:00: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
12/03/2017, 22:12:08: Alex Brown: I agree with rich
12/03/2017, 22:12:13: Rich: I think most places near london would be thoroughly disapointing
12/03/2017, 22:12:24: Alex Brown: Look at all of the london south of the river
12/03/2017, 22:12:27: Rich: gloucester onwards looks really lovely. Actually check it out
12/03/2017, 22:12:30: sil: <‎image omitted>
12/03/2017, 22:12:45: sil: big strip of green to Canterbury
12/03/2017, 22:12:49: sil: ignore blue line
12/03/2017, 22:13:07: Alex Brown: Theres alot of main road bits
12/03/2017, 22:13:38: Alex Brown: I dunno for me I dont think that route down england looks very appealing
12/03/2017, 22:14:08: Alex Brown: Id rather do glocester to weston super mare if theres a choice between the two
12/03/2017, 22:14:29: Alex Brown: Also james is from bristol so he knows the area
12/03/2017, 22:14:37: Alex Brown: That could be useful
12/03/2017, 22:14:46: sil: bristol is very hilly you guys realise
12/03/2017, 22:15:07: sil: like lots more hills than we've ever done on one of these rides
12/03/2017, 22:15:12: Alex Brown: Coast line isnt too bad
12/03/2017, 22:17:04: sil: we won't be able to still to coast line. there are a lot of estuarys and the mottorway pretty much runs by the coast
12/03/2017, 22:17:13: sil: we will be forced around a lot
12/03/2017, 22:17:37: sil: we would pretty much be following the M5
12/03/2017, 22:19:16: Alex Brown: Hmm I dunno rich what do you think
12/03/2017, 22:21:00: sil: the leg from Gloucester to Weston-super-Mare is a lot more built up than the Shropshire Gloucester leg
12/03/2017, 22:23:17: Alex Brown: Its nice though
12/03/2017, 22:23:25: sil: and the parts that aren't built up will be very Hilly
12/03/2017, 22:23:29: Alex Brown: Not sure about bristol though
12/03/2017, 22:24:05: Alex Brown: Cotswolds would be nice but hilly
12/03/2017, 22:24:19: Alex Brown: All of the nice parts of england are hilly
12/03/2017, 22:24:41: Alex Brown: Norfolk is flat and pretty
12/03/2017, 22:25:05: sil: yeah that's true. but the west country is like known for its very hillyness
12/03/2017, 22:25:15: sil: Norfolk is very flat. and I've never been there
12/03/2017, 22:25:26: sil: oh actually I forgot I have. but very rarely
12/03/2017, 22:25:33: Alex Brown: Norfolk is also too far
12/03/2017, 22:25:50: Alex Brown: Suffolk is where well end up
12/03/2017, 22:25:55: sil: why not cycle to Cambridge?
12/03/2017, 22:25:55: Alex Brown: But same thing
12/03/2017, 22:26:07: Alex Brown: I was just thinking that
12/03/2017, 22:26:55: Alex Brown: That also looks nice
12/03/2017, 22:27:07: sil: http://rides.tomtaylor.co.uk/routes/london-cambridge.html
12/03/2017, 22:27:09: Alex Brown: A little motorway crossing
12/03/2017, 22:28:00: sil: "It's a nice wend up through the home counties, on quiet country lanes, and if you're lucky, with the wind at your back."
12/03/2017, 22:28:25: sil: Cambridge is also very pretty, lots of pubs, and known for cycling
12/03/2017, 22:28:40: Alex Brown: Nice
12/03/2017, 22:28:53: Alex Brown: Road could be less busy
12/03/2017, 22:28:55: sil: yiu can go up the Lea valley a lot of the way
12/03/2017, 22:29:00: Alex Brown: And waterways?
12/03/2017, 22:29:05: sil: Lea valley
12/03/2017, 22:29:16: Alex Brown: Any* waterways
12/03/2017, 22:30:40: sil: yeah looks like a rover we can follow
12/03/2017, 22:30:51: sil: gets countryside pretty quick from richs
12/03/2017, 22:31:53: Alex Brown: Yeh I like that idea
12/03/2017, 22:32:10: Alex Brown: Similar route to what I thought
12/03/2017, 22:32:12: sil: after lea valley it's country. accessible from richs.
12/03/2017, 22:32:34: Alex Brown: Best way out of london
12/03/2017, 22:32:38: sil: and Cambridge is a nice looking city with historical pubs
12/03/2017, 22:32:40: sil: yeah
12/03/2017, 22:32:59: Alex Brown: Rich said he wasnt keen on leavalley tho
12/03/2017, 22:33:14: Alex Brown: As it was industrial for the majority
12/03/2017, 22:33:29: sil: we would cycle through it in half a day
12/03/2017, 22:33:39: sil: then it's country. better than roads and it's flat
12/03/2017, 22:34:00: Alex Brown: Is it 4 days worth of cycling
12/03/2017, 22:34:18: sil: it's 57 miles
12/03/2017, 22:34:23: sil: what did we do last time?
12/03/2017, 22:34:35: sil: Cambridge has really good cycle routes around it as well
12/03/2017, 22:36:40: sil: 54 miles actually
12/03/2017, 22:38:20: Alex Brown: 60 but it was more like half a day whole day the half day
12/03/2017, 22:39:03: sil: how many days we gonna do this time?
12/03/2017, 22:40:48: Alex Brown: 4
12/03/2017, 22:41:00: Alex Brown: Friday morning to monday
12/03/2017, 22:41:06: sil: Cambridge will be easy then
12/03/2017, 22:41:10: Alex Brown: Maybe monday after noon
12/03/2017, 22:41:17: Alex Brown: 3+ days
12/03/2017, 22:42:11: Alex Brown: We can try oxford if we get to cambridge quick
12/03/2017, 22:42:23: sil: Oxford is not close
12/03/2017, 22:42:44: Alex Brown: Its dificult as you have to prebook your bike on a virgin train
12/03/2017, 22:42:59: Alex Brown: They are known to straight up refuse you
12/03/2017, 22:43:09: Alex Brown: If its not prebooked
12/03/2017, 22:44:13: sil: I think Cambridge is the best option so far. right distance. flat, good country, great city to end in, and we don't have to waste half a day getting a  train to start the journey
12/03/2017, 22:45:05: Alex Brown: Yeh sounds good to me
12/03/2017, 22:45:16: Alex Brown: But I think we might get further
12/03/2017, 22:45:50: sil: we could go to Peterborough after Cambridge?
12/03/2017, 22:46:08: sil: actually that's an extra 40 miles
12/03/2017, 22:47:47: Alex Brown: Yeh just looked its 95 miles
13/03/2017, 08:32:35: Rich: it's a bit short to cambridge but yeah we could go to Peterborough
13/03/2017, 08:32:39: Rich: what happened to the coast?
13/03/2017, 08:33:09: Rich: also, the route from gloucester is extremely flat except for in Bristol because it's on an estuary
13/03/2017, 08:36:56: sil: I think we've identified a good route out of london
13/03/2017, 08:39:38: Rich: it inevitably won't be as rural for being near London
13/03/2017, 08:41:01: Rich: we would probably end up camping near the m11 by the looks of it
13/03/2017, 08:41:05: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/51.5849121,-0.0167776/Cambridge/@51.8918581,-0.1637058,75380m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!4m9!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d85d89f32a012d:0x63a320e1a35e3d21!2m2!1d0.121817!2d52.205337!3e1?hl=en
13/03/2017, 08:41:28: sil: nah it's fine
13/03/2017, 08:41:59: sil: ur route was m5 all the way
13/03/2017, 08:42:43: sil: http://rides.tomtaylor.co.uk/routes/london-cambridge.html
13/03/2017, 08:42:50: sil: read that
13/03/2017, 08:42:59: sil: sounds very rural
13/03/2017, 08:43:36: Rich: I saw it
13/03/2017, 08:44:05: sil: then you know it's not mottorway
13/03/2017, 08:44:57: Rich: we could aim for Kings Lynn I guess
13/03/2017, 08:44:58: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/38+West+Avenue+Road,+London+E17+9SE,+UK/King's+Lynn/@52.2046497,0.2265979,121013m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48761deeb990594f:0xf8693d230e61fb56!2m2!1d-0.0167678!2d51.584412!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d77e2caa84773f:0x45f310134b25799b!2m2!1d0.4022963!2d52.7516798!3e1?hl=en
13/03/2017, 08:46:30: sil: a loser move driven g from London to cambridge before. it gets rural surprisingly quick
13/03/2017, 08:46:48: sil: typing errors
13/03/2017, 08:47:07: sil: I've driven
13/03/2017, 08:47:19: Rich: haha
13/03/2017, 08:47:23: Rich: that is a loser move
13/03/2017, 08:47:31: Rich: yeah I've been on the train and it looks nice
13/03/2017, 08:48:00: Rich: I just prefer extremely rural areas, and home counties always give me a sense of not-quite-rural
13/03/2017, 08:48:24: Rich: like, there's always a motorway or big town around the corner
13/03/2017, 08:48:26: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/38+West+Avenue+Road,+London+E17+9SE,+UK/King's+Lynn/@52.5822228,0.1809963,58752m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x48761deeb990594f:0xf8693d230e61fb56!2m2!1d-0.0167678!2d51.584412!3m4!1m2!1d0.2419284!2d52.6556719!3s0x47d81cf99d56b493:0xc9dd018adb16acd8!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d77e2caa84773f:0x45f310134b25799b!2m2!1d0.4022963!2d52.7516798!3e1?hl=en
13/03/2017, 08:48:48: Rich: 110 miles to Kings Lynn via only lanes. Basically flat past Cambridge.
13/03/2017, 08:49:40: Rich: there's a direct train back to kings cross
13/03/2017, 08:51:54: sil: thats quite a distance. but guess we have the them
13/03/2017, 08:51:59: sil: time
13/03/2017, 08:52:26: Rich: how many days are we doing?
13/03/2017, 08:52:45: Rich: being as it's flat and principally road it should be surprisingly easy
13/03/2017, 09:08:45: sil: easter bank holiday is the Friday and Monday. could have 4. I'd be up for taking a days holiday and making 5 tho
13/03/2017, 09:09:21: Rich: yeah we could easily make kings lynn
13/03/2017, 09:09:24: sil: Just gotta get good distance first day to maximize rurualness
13/03/2017, 09:09:25: Rich: I think four days is fine
13/03/2017, 09:09:48: Rich: we probably want to stop short of Cambridge to find somewhere to camp
13/03/2017, 09:10:10: sil: how big is kings Lynn?
13/03/2017, 09:10:46: Rich: not very
13/03/2017, 09:10:57: Rich: I picked it because it's on the coast and has a train line
13/03/2017, 09:11:10: Rich: it looks like we would struggle to find a decent camping spot on the first night
13/03/2017, 09:11:56: sil: looks like a pleasant market town. would be nice to go to cambridge aswell
13/03/2017, 09:12:05: sil: is it super long to go via Cambridge?
13/03/2017, 09:12:56: Rich: Cambridge is on the way
13/03/2017, 09:14:19: sil: oh nice
13/03/2017, 09:14:56: sil: http://pubs.cambridge-camra.org.uk
13/03/2017, 09:15:01: sil: important guide
13/03/2017, 10:12:35: sil: recon we could get to patmore heath on first day?
the  we g across field and camp near River ash
13/03/2017, 10:13:54: sil: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 10:15:05: sil: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 10:15:28: sil: actually lots of woods on other side
13/03/2017, 10:16:20: sil: if we get there first day that's  pretty much half way to cambridge
13/03/2017, 10:16:32: sil: but gets us past the sprawl
13/03/2017, 10:29:17: Rich: There's a bunch of houses and a farm. It would probably feel a bit sketchy
13/03/2017, 10:29:42: Rich: There's a bigger patch of forest further north but I really think we'll struggle to find a good camping
Spot
13/03/2017, 10:31:02: sil: yeah I saw that woods
13/03/2017, 10:31:58: Rich: here might be better:
13/03/2017, 10:31:59: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/51%C2%B059'00.0%22N+0%C2%B003'45.9%22E/@51.9833423,0.0605653,590m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d51.983339!4d0.062754?hl=en
13/03/2017, 10:32:05: Rich: also gets us further from stansted...
13/03/2017, 10:32:18: sil: yeh a that's the wood I saw
13/03/2017, 10:32:32: sil: extra 7 miles tho
13/03/2017, 10:33:04: sil: but we can do it
13/03/2017, 10:33:08: Rich: we can do 35 miles in a day
13/03/2017, 10:33:24: sil: yeah totally. start early from yours
13/03/2017, 13:27:43: sil: we can do some site seeing in Cambridge
13/03/2017, 13:28:00: sil: and by site seeing, I mean smashing  beers
13/03/2017, 13:28:01: sil: lad
13/03/2017, 13:44:43: sil: we gonna take the Tuesday off aswell?
13/03/2017, 13:51:15: sil: or just stick to the bank holiday days?
13/03/2017, 13:57:51: Rich: I reckon we should just stick to the bank holiday
13/03/2017, 13:57:55: Rich: That's still 4 days
13/03/2017, 13:58:08: Rich: Particularly seeing as we don't have to travel to or from places first
13/03/2017, 13:58:16: Rich: We've only ever done 3 days before
13/03/2017, 13:59:12: sil: yeah true dat
13/03/2017, 14:00:51: Rich: My current brew will be ready in time for the trip
13/03/2017, 14:01:24: Rich: We can get fucked up for free on the first day
13/03/2017, 14:03:09: Alex Brown: Yay vast amounts of excercise whilst being poisoned
13/03/2017, 14:04:02: Rich: Describing 100 miles of cycling as vast amounts of exercise? Cute.
13/03/2017, 14:04:45: Rich: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 14:16:53: sil: bants
13/03/2017, 14:16:53: sil: maybe Alex meant the exercise is the poison
13/03/2017, 14:16:55: sil: or the fresh air?
13/03/2017, 14:20:19: Rich: Can't be away from your sweet London smog Alex?
13/03/2017, 14:22:17: sil: will be embarrassing for Alex when he realises all the climbing we've been doing has made us buff and strong
13/03/2017, 14:23:18: Rich: Yes mate well bench
13/03/2017, 14:23:39: Rich: We should go via lots of gates to carry our bikes over
13/03/2017, 14:24:05: sil: we should plan a route with some cliff faces
13/03/2017, 14:24:25: Rich: Yeah or a path that goes over some boulders
13/03/2017, 14:29:58: sil: we shouldn't mock Alex really.  if we come across a path which is mostly an xbox simulation he'll dick us
13/03/2017, 15:32:01: sil: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/watch-grown-man-storms-robot-12732958.amp
13/03/2017, 15:32:10: sil: that guys having none of it
13/03/2017, 16:18:40: Rich: Lol
13/03/2017, 16:18:46: Rich: That's pretty lame
13/03/2017, 16:24:49: sil: robot battling is a sport for MEN. not little children
13/03/2017, 16:30:06: Rich: They only gave it to them because they were kids
13/03/2017, 16:33:55: sil: there's a very grand cathedral in Ely we should check out on route
13/03/2017, 16:35:00: Rich: There's also a place called clavering
13/03/2017, 16:35:13: Rich: I like to image it's a twisted mirror version of claverley
13/03/2017, 16:35:45: sil: we gonna go to the washing national nature reserve?
13/03/2017, 16:35:56: sil: wash*
13/03/2017, 16:37:19: sil: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 16:37:34: sil: apparently there are seal sometimes
13/03/2017, 16:37:50: Rich: Yeah
13/03/2017, 16:38:09: Rich: It's another few miles past kings lynn but we should definitely go
13/03/2017, 16:38:52: sil: if we do good time we could head there first. camp. and head to Kings Lynn for the final piss up the next day
13/03/2017, 16:39:00: sil: would have to do very good time tho
13/03/2017, 16:40:20: sil: btw kings Lynn actually looks really crap for pubs
13/03/2017, 16:44:02: sil: you know, it's the same distance to Norfolk.
capital of Norwich.....
13/03/2017, 16:44:22: sil: would be a better end point.
BUT we don't get to the sea....
13/03/2017, 16:44:24: sil: hmmm..
13/03/2017, 16:45:01: Rich: I checked and I think Norwich is further
13/03/2017, 16:45:07: Rich: Also yeah no sea
13/03/2017, 16:45:17: Rich: I think the wash would be a really cool place to end up
13/03/2017, 16:45:20: sil: Norwich yeah.
oh yeah yiur right
13/03/2017, 16:45:25: sil: it's quite a bit further
13/03/2017, 16:45:59: sil: yeah I agree.
but I do kind of like the tradition of the final day pub  crawl
13/03/2017, 16:47:24: sil: Chester was a pretty good place to end with all those awesome pubs
13/03/2017, 16:48:13: Rich: Yeh
13/03/2017, 16:48:26: Rich: Well we can just wreak havoc in kings lynn
13/03/2017, 16:48:53: sil: there best rated pub is a weatherspoons...
13/03/2017, 16:50:37: Rich: Banging
13/03/2017, 17:12:16: sil: just realised that our planned date is only a month away.
is it really gonna be warm enough?
13/03/2017, 17:12:54: Rich: Our first ride was a similar time of year
13/03/2017, 17:13:29: sil: it rained quite a bit on that ride I recall
13/03/2017, 17:13:51: Rich: Yeah. It'll be alright though
13/03/2017, 17:15:16: sil: not safer to go for spring bank holiday, end of may?
13/03/2017, 17:15:32: sil: and take one day holiday
13/03/2017, 17:17:12: sil: early April can be pretty rainy
13/03/2017, 17:17:55: Rich: Nah April is fine
13/03/2017, 17:18:22: sil: we want the best trip tho rich. we should seriously consider the trip to make it good
13/03/2017, 17:18:51: sil: not just go "nah itl be fine" and then have a wet and miserable time
13/03/2017, 17:22:10: Rich: It might rain. It might not. It's a gamble we take. Either way we'll have fun
13/03/2017, 17:23:59: sil: well lets discuss it. why is it better to do it early April over late may?
13/03/2017, 17:24:31: Rich: Because it's sooner and we have lots of holiday time
13/03/2017, 17:24:39: sil: advantage, extra bank holiday day.
disadvantage, colder at night, higher chance of rain
13/03/2017, 17:27:58: sil: our last trip was the same bank holiday. last week of may. and it was glorious
13/03/2017, 17:28:43: Rich: Our first trip was fine. Don't be pussy!
13/03/2017, 17:28:47: sil: our first trip was 3rd of may
13/03/2017, 17:29:06: sil: this will be almost a month earlier than any trip we've done
13/03/2017, 17:29:36: sil: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 17:29:56: sil: we will have less light hours than any trip
13/03/2017, 17:30:20: Rich: Oh shit
13/03/2017, 17:30:23: Rich: Yeah maybe then
13/03/2017, 17:30:57: Rich: What date is may bank holiday? I feel like Alex was away or something
13/03/2017, 17:31:19: sil: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 17:31:30: sil: may Bank holiday is the first week
13/03/2017, 17:31:40: sil: I purposefully didn't suggest that week cus Alex is busy
13/03/2017, 17:32:55: sil: it's annoying to wait. but feel like we're being a but optimistic with the 2nd week of April. it'll still be cold at night. I dunno. let's see what Alex thinks
13/03/2017, 17:33:44: sil: it's been a very quiet day at work today
13/03/2017, 17:35:13: Rich: I can tell
13/03/2017, 17:36:11: sil: I'm sorry for calling such a divisive referendum. but I feel itl be in the public interest
13/03/2017, 17:36:41: Rich: Average rainfall is actually the same for April and May
13/03/2017, 17:36:57: sil: what about night and day temp
13/03/2017, 17:37:07: Rich: Average temperature difference is like 1C every two weeks
13/03/2017, 17:37:07: sil: that's the big one
13/03/2017, 17:37:24: Rich: So it would be like 1C colder than the early May ride
13/03/2017, 17:37:45: sil: and what's the light hours difference?
13/03/2017, 17:38:11: sil: remember this is the last week of may. going Into June
13/03/2017, 17:38:29: sil: probably best to do statistics to the week, not monthly average
13/03/2017, 17:38:49: Rich: April 14th daylight from 6am till 8pm
13/03/2017, 17:39:10: sil: and may 28th?
13/03/2017, 17:39:26: Rich: 4am till 9pm
13/03/2017, 17:39:33: Rich: So in us being awake terms we get one hour
13/03/2017, 17:39:47: Rich: It would be nicer but I'd still rough it and do April
13/03/2017, 17:39:51: Rich: I just wanna get outside
13/03/2017, 17:41:35: sil: I dunno. don't wanna be hasty and ruin the trip. could do something more climate appropriate that bank holiday
13/03/2017, 17:42:12: Rich: Let's see what Alex says
13/03/2017, 17:42:24: sil: yeah
13/03/2017, 17:42:27: Rich: I just got a flashback of pitching a tent in Tewksbury
13/03/2017, 17:42:54: sil: and the rolling rain that forced us into bus shelters
13/03/2017, 17:43:29: Rich: It made it fun and memorable
13/03/2017, 17:43:34: Rich: It was the best bike ride
13/03/2017, 17:43:49: sil: nah
13/03/2017, 17:43:53: sil: last one was way better
13/03/2017, 17:45:00: sil: you can't deny the camping was a lot more pleasant
13/03/2017, 17:45:33: Rich: Our first camp site on the first ride was great
13/03/2017, 17:45:42: Rich: It's just in Tewksbury that it went down hill
13/03/2017, 17:45:55: sil: yeah it was night. but I still remember it being wet and dewy
13/03/2017, 17:46:01: sil: nice*
13/03/2017, 17:46:24: sil: last trip every spot was good. and it was dry enoigh for fires every night
13/03/2017, 17:46:39: sil: and we always had enough light to pitch and collect wood
13/03/2017, 17:47:13: sil: remember 1st trip was 3 weeks further into summer than the currently proposed date
13/03/2017, 17:50:06: Rich: Yeah it's true.
13/03/2017, 17:50:25: Rich: Might go home for Easter weekend instead in that case
13/03/2017, 17:50:43: sil: yeah that's what I'd do aswell
13/03/2017, 17:51:00: sil: I could go for easter meal.
But let's see what Alex says
13/03/2017, 18:21:01: Alex Brown: Wtf
13/03/2017, 18:47:18: Alex Brown: I cant do any may bank holidays
13/03/2017, 18:47:30: Alex Brown: It will be august if so
13/03/2017, 18:50:51: sil: longest daylight hours in August
13/03/2017, 18:54:18: sil: I just think one of those summer bank holidays I want to go Shropshire, and one I was to do bike ride. makes more sense to choose the warmest date to do the more outdoor activity. plus easter there's a family meal
13/03/2017, 18:55:23: Alex Brown: This is lame
13/03/2017, 18:55:24: sil: I doubt were gonna get the opportunity to do a bike ride twice this year. so just don't want blow it before its great wheather
13/03/2017, 18:55:30: Alex Brown: Your cancelling
13/03/2017, 18:56:20: sil: I'm not cancelling. I just don't wanna jizz it away without planning it properly. cause I bet we don't get the opportunity to do another one this year
13/03/2017, 18:57:06: sil: we can still do a good outdoor thing for easter In Shropshire
13/03/2017, 19:00:26: Rich: I'm up for doing it in April
13/03/2017, 19:00:28: Rich: Let's do it
13/03/2017, 19:00:29: Alex Brown: I wont be there at easter if you cancel
13/03/2017, 19:00:32: Rich: No pussy
13/03/2017, 19:00:43: Alex Brown: I agree
13/03/2017, 19:01:02: Alex Brown: Easter is the best time
13/03/2017, 19:01:15: Alex Brown: Everyone who wants to do it is free
13/03/2017, 19:01:30: Alex Brown: And thats getting rarer the older we get
13/03/2017, 19:07:56: sil: ok well do 2 then?
13/03/2017, 19:09:49: sil: or do you just wanna jizz is away early summer?
13/03/2017, 19:14:24: Alex Brown: Im up for 2
13/03/2017, 19:14:33: Alex Brown: Im bronging my bike down
13/03/2017, 19:14:37: sil: you guys do Gloucester in April the we can  all do Cambridge in Aug
13/03/2017, 19:14:49: Alex Brown: So is james
13/03/2017, 19:14:55: Alex Brown: Dont be lame
13/03/2017, 19:15:27: sil: if we do 2 I'll come in Aug
13/03/2017, 19:15:50: Alex Brown: Your trying to work it for your date
13/03/2017, 19:16:07: Alex Brown: What are you doing easter
13/03/2017, 19:16:21: sil: this way I can go to family meal and still do a bike ride
13/03/2017, 19:16:54: Alex Brown: Have you just found out about this meal?
13/03/2017, 19:17:25: sil: I didn't really think about it when I suggested the easter bank holiday originally
13/03/2017, 19:17:37: sil: all I saw was 2 days of bank holiday
13/03/2017, 19:18:07: Alex Brown: Thats dumb
13/03/2017, 19:18:21: Alex Brown: When is it
13/03/2017, 19:18:26: Alex Brown: The middle?
13/03/2017, 19:18:43: sil: when's what?
13/03/2017, 19:18:55: sil: the meal?
13/03/2017, 19:19:37: sil: the Sunday usually
13/03/2017, 19:20:12: Alex Brown: Do you have to go?
13/03/2017, 19:20:58: sil: no, but if I can still do both then that's the best of both worlds
13/03/2017, 19:22:42: Rich: If alex literally can't do May we should do April
13/03/2017, 19:22:51: Rich: It's not going to be that cold
13/03/2017, 19:23:12: Alex Brown: This is very annoying Ive made nicolas extended family alter tables so me and james can come
13/03/2017, 19:23:22: Alex Brown: Im not doing may
13/03/2017, 19:23:32: sil: I have this suggested may
13/03/2017, 19:23:35: sil: haven't
13/03/2017, 19:23:43: sil: since Alex said he was busy
13/03/2017, 19:23:50: Alex Brown: I am busy
13/03/2017, 19:24:26: sil: I know
13/03/2017, 19:24:36: sil: that's why I'm now saying August for the 2nd one
13/03/2017, 19:25:09: Alex Brown: I want to go away over august and Id like to take bank holiday
13/03/2017, 19:25:35: Alex Brown: So I can leave a day for richs bday
13/03/2017, 19:26:03: Alex Brown: Barely got days left
13/03/2017, 19:27:56: Alex Brown: I dont think theres anything wrong with the weather
13/03/2017, 19:28:57: Alex Brown: I doubt its going to happen at all if its not easter
13/03/2017, 19:29:45: sil: I'm gonna go home easter bank holiday. I'm not just nay saying for the sake of it. I was the one who suggested this date in the first place
13/03/2017, 19:30:41: sil: but I didn't think it through. I should go home. my parents come back from south Africa first week of April and they wanna see bryony
13/03/2017, 19:35:50: Rich: I'm going on a cruise in August and potentially shambala too
13/03/2017, 19:36:01: Rich: I'd much rather do it in April
13/03/2017, 19:36:33: Rich: Or may. I'm easy. But you should have been more up front about your reasons
13/03/2017, 19:38:22: sil: oh the weather thing is still a big reason
13/03/2017, 19:38:35: sil: I'd change plans if I knew it was gonna a be super nice and hot
13/03/2017, 19:39:02: sil: but it's probably not, so I'd rather do the thing I should do
13/03/2017, 19:39:14: Alex Brown: Im busy may
13/03/2017, 19:39:26: Alex Brown: And probs august
13/03/2017, 19:39:53: Alex Brown: It really is going to be easter or next year
13/03/2017, 19:40:05: Alex Brown: Unfortunately I have no days left
13/03/2017, 19:40:16: Alex Brown: Ive ised them up
13/03/2017, 20:47:07: Rich: <‎image omitted>
13/03/2017, 20:51:52: sil: <‎image omitted>
14/03/2017, 13:35:09: sil: <‎image omitted>
14/03/2017, 16:20:01: sil: <‎image omitted>
14/03/2017, 16:40:41: Rich: Dream come true
14/03/2017, 17:10:22: sil: you know what, I might go to shabala this year
14/03/2017, 17:10:45: Rich: Is the lineup good?
14/03/2017, 17:11:02: Rich: I may go if we get to do something there
14/03/2017, 17:11:08: sil: I heard it might be the only year in ages that it won't be a sham
14/03/2017, 17:11:44: sil: in don't know to be fair. but realised I've got very few plans this summer. Would be up for another small festival
14/03/2017, 17:11:49: Rich: If we go it won't be. It's schrodingrrs sham
14/03/2017, 17:12:12: Rich: We were considering glasto resale as I don't think it's on next year
14/03/2017, 17:13:10: sil: ah I don't know about Glastonbury this year. I love it, but it's a big effort I guess
14/03/2017, 17:16:10: sil: it seems impossible that we'd be able to get everyone to agree to go
14/03/2017, 17:16:59: sil: could go field day. line up looks alright. but thats a London festival. kind of a bit lame not to get away from the city
14/03/2017, 17:20:12: Rich: Field day lineup is great but yeah I'd prefer a real festival
14/03/2017, 17:20:39: sil: yeah same. it's the sort of ticket you buy day tickets for. not really the same
14/03/2017, 17:37:04: sil: green man has a decent line up this year
14/03/2017, 17:37:17: sil: time to give that fest another shot?
14/03/2017, 17:38:25: sil: the shins, conor oberst, Kate tempest, Daniel Johnston, badbadnotgood, timber timbre,
14/03/2017, 17:38:36: sil: in fact that's a great line up!
best I've seen so far
14/03/2017, 17:51:06: Rich: Oh shit that's great
14/03/2017, 17:51:49: sil: go have a look
14/03/2017, 17:52:05: sil: I think it's grown a but since we last went
14/03/2017, 17:52:11: sil: bit*
14/03/2017, 17:53:08: Rich: Ah we're on holiday
14/03/2017, 17:53:32: sil: ah that's a shame
14/03/2017, 17:56:41: sil: genuinely the best line up ive seen so far
14/03/2017, 17:56:59: Rich: Yeah
15/03/2017, 13:53:41: Alex Brown: Today is glorious
15/03/2017, 13:54:00: Alex Brown: We sholud have bike riden today
15/03/2017, 13:54:10: Rich: It would be a lovely day for a cycle trip
15/03/2017, 13:54:26: Alex Brown: Was just walking around thinking that
15/03/2017, 13:56:03: sil: it is very surprisingly warm March day
15/03/2017, 13:56:46: sil: actually having lunch outside as a first this year
15/03/2017, 14:01:14: sil: yo rich, looking at bouldering pads. we can buy one for around £100
15/03/2017, 14:01:28: Rich: Tempting
15/03/2017, 14:01:33: sil: or places do rent them depending on where we go
15/03/2017, 14:01:34: Rich: Would rather buy shoes first though
15/03/2017, 14:01:43: Rich: Maybe if we decide to go outdoors we can buy on then
15/03/2017, 14:01:48: sil: a place in Sheffield rents £12 per day
15/03/2017, 14:01:49: Rich: Or get a friend with one to come
15/03/2017, 14:01:51: Alex Brown: Agreed to go to ascot on the august bank holidy with nicols fam
15/03/2017, 14:02:14: Alex Brown: Just realised
15/03/2017, 14:02:29: Alex Brown: We have to take time off to do the trip this year
15/03/2017, 14:02:41: sil: we only have to take 1 day off really
15/03/2017, 14:02:49: sil: we can  do cycle trip whenever
15/03/2017, 14:03:01: sil: we usually do it in 3 days
15/03/2017, 14:03:02: Alex Brown: I was up for a 4 day trip tho
15/03/2017, 14:03:24: Alex Brown: Are you sure you absolutely cant do easter
15/03/2017, 14:03:46: Rich: We could do like a 2 day from Shropshire in Easter...?
15/03/2017, 14:03:55: sil: yeh totally
15/03/2017, 14:04:12: Alex Brown: We can do that
15/03/2017, 14:04:21: Alex Brown: But sil will be with bry
15/03/2017, 14:04:31: sil: I mean, Alex there is nothing I have to do. but I would feel guilty for not turning up to something when cycling is something we can do any weekend really
15/03/2017, 14:05:02: Alex Brown: Fair enough just trying, as im booked in aug
15/03/2017, 14:05:05: sil: oh yeah I'll be with bryony. but I could come for a day cycle and leave bry at home
15/03/2017, 14:05:26: Alex Brown: Yeh we could do a warm up trip
15/03/2017, 14:05:30: sil: we can go in June. I'm sure you have at least one day to take off for your friends
15/03/2017, 14:05:43: Alex Brown: Yeh lets do that
15/03/2017, 14:05:57: Rich: Yeah June would be good
15/03/2017, 14:05:58: Alex Brown: But I reckon mid may is better
15/03/2017, 14:06:04: Alex Brown: June is hott
15/03/2017, 14:06:24: Rich: I could do any weekend in May except the first
15/03/2017, 14:06:33: Rich: I'd like to go sooner rather than later
15/03/2017, 14:06:40: Alex Brown: I can do mid but not late
15/03/2017, 14:07:10: Rich: 12th?

15/03/2017, 14:08:07: sil: I say first week June
15/03/2017, 14:08:09: Rich: Else there's a decent chance I'll find another commitment in its place
15/03/2017, 14:08:18: Rich: Let's vote
15/03/2017, 14:08:20: Rich: I vote may

15/03/2017, 14:14:52: sil: but gotta be somewhat flexible for the British weather
15/03/2017, 14:14:53: Alex Brown: For me
15/03/2017, 14:39:01: sil: we can cycle to those newly found caves in Shropshire
15/03/2017, 15:09:29: Rich: They're pretty close
15/03/2017, 15:09:35: Rich: Like 20min drive

15/03/2017, 16:11:32: Rich: North of claverley
15/03/2017, 16:11:39: Rich: So basically telford
15/03/2017, 16:12:40: sil: could cycle to somewhere in North Shropshire that we rarely go
15/03/2017, 16:13:01: sil: hawkstone area
15/03/2017, 16:24:20: Alex Brown: Lets do market drayton

15/03/2017, 18:50:19: Rich: it's a bit far
15/03/2017, 18:50:25: Rich: over 30 miles each way
15/03/2017, 18:50:38: Rich: I'm pretty sure we camped out just the other side of Nordbury on our last trip

16/03/2017, 08:12:16: sil: but your bike will be at yours. you'd have to bring your bike to mine and pretty much cycle past yiur house
16/03/2017, 08:12:31: sil: it's not 20mins to yours
16/03/2017, 08:12:43: Alex Brown: I dont mind cycling
16/03/2017, 08:12:46: sil: your cycling time perception is off
16/03/2017, 08:13:01: Alex Brown: I remember it was supprisingly fast
16/03/2017, 08:13:38: Alex Brown: Not much longer than driving the long way through six ashes
16/03/2017, 08:24:37: Alex Brown: Yeh your right

16/03/2017, 08:36:17: sil: including stops for water and waiting for Alex
16/03/2017, 08:37:44: Rich: Maps for cycling is pretty accurate if it's continuous
16/03/2017, 08:37:50: Rich: I don't want to sell us short
16/03/2017, 08:38:03: Rich: Maybe we can cycle from clav and meet alex

16/03/2017, 08:47:09: Rich: Yeah we could do that
16/03/2017, 08:47:28: Rich: I'd even start and end in clav cause I'm just that sport
16/03/2017, 08:54:18: Alex Brown: Cute
16/03/2017, 08:55:20: Rich: Please don't be derisive alex. You know I'm sensitive about my weight
16/03/2017, 09:24:45: Alex Brown: Im the fittest
16/03/2017, 10:48:07: sil: I shit sorry guys, just realised I was being a  pussy. we should take a detour and cycle up the Clee Hill aswell
16/03/2017, 10:48:25: sil: we should do it twice cause it'll be too easy only once
16/03/2017, 10:48:41: Rich: Oh yeah and then I guess we could pop into Wales
16/03/2017, 10:49:27: sil: haha, who the fuck is this PUSSY??

16/03/2017, 11:10:36: Alex Brown: Cause im so strong and fast
16/03/2017, 11:10:53: sil: that's true. you will need a handicap bike
16/03/2017, 11:10:55: Rich: I hope sil is planning on doing it on his foldy
16/03/2017, 11:11:02: Rich: LOL

16/03/2017, 11:12:01: Alex Brown: Sil bought a shit bike which he no longer uses for its purpose because bryony told him to
16/03/2017, 11:12:17: Rich: At least he uses it
16/03/2017, 11:12:20: sil: rich sees me ride that bike a lot
16/03/2017, 11:12:28: Alex Brown: Does he fuck
16/03/2017, 11:12:38: sil: I ride it at least twice a week
16/03/2017, 11:12:48: sil: and that's at minimum
16/03/2017, 11:12:56: Alex Brown: Not seen evidence
16/03/2017, 11:13:11: sil: rich will approve my statements
16/03/2017, 11:13:19: Alex Brown: Hardly as fit as me
16/03/2017, 11:14:00: Rich: I see him ride it once or twice a week
16/03/2017, 11:14:14: sil: there you go.
16/03/2017, 11:14:23: Alex Brown: I save up my fit
16/03/2017, 11:14:30: sil: fat*
16/03/2017, 11:14:31: Alex Brown: And cycle twice a year
16/03/2017, 11:15:04: Alex Brown: I have an abundance of fit
16/03/2017, 11:15:27: sil: yep, fittest bastard I know

16/03/2017, 11:17:27: sil: how long are we gonna have to wait for you on this bike ride?
16/03/2017, 11:17:45: Alex Brown: Cute
16/03/2017, 11:17:52: Rich: I'll try to keep up guys I promise!
16/03/2017, 11:18:14: Alex Brown: Youre just upset because you bought a useless fag bike
16/03/2017, 11:18:35: sil: There is a patten emerging here. Alex always trash talks pre bike ride.  and then when we're on it he cries after having to pick his bike over a fence all alone
16/03/2017, 11:18:46: Rich: Haha
16/03/2017, 11:18:59: sil: what a hard man
16/03/2017, 11:19:05: Rich: He's very confident when he's not riding a bike
16/03/2017, 11:19:23: Rich: I'm sure that foldy will be very useful when you want to get on the tube in the Shropshire countryside
16/03/2017, 11:19:41: sil: yes. he keeps up in confidence, that much is true
16/03/2017, 11:20:08: sil: obvs i will borrow dad's VERY expensive bike in Shropshire
16/03/2017, 11:20:16: Alex Brown: Cute
16/03/2017, 11:20:32: Alex Brown: Maybe you should get your own real bike
16/03/2017, 11:20:48: Alex Brown: Instead of a portable
16/03/2017, 11:20:53: sil: when I have my own flat on may
16/03/2017, 11:21:08: sil: the foldy Is good for lodging
16/03/2017, 11:21:22: Rich: You could ride it on the foldy just fine
16/03/2017, 11:21:35: sil: why would I bother?
16/03/2017, 11:21:41: sil: when I can use a better bike
16/03/2017, 11:21:45: Alex Brown: Still moving to stratford
16/03/2017, 11:21:49: Rich: Dunno, proving that your bike is good
16/03/2017, 11:21:56: Rich: Why cycle when you could drive?
16/03/2017, 11:22:05: sil: you don't use a pen knife to cut down a tree
16/03/2017, 11:22:25: sil: you use appropriate tools for appropriate jobs
16/03/2017, 11:22:35: sil: foldy is a city short distance bike
16/03/2017, 11:22:39: Rich: Lol your foldy is a pen knife compared to the chainsaw that is a real bike
16/03/2017, 11:22:49: Rich: Knives are better suited to the city I guess
16/03/2017, 11:22:51: Alex Brown: (My bike)
16/03/2017, 11:23:12: sil: your bike is surly a pile of rust by now?
16/03/2017, 11:23:21: Alex Brown: Cute
16/03/2017, 11:23:24: Rich: Your bike is so bulky alex
16/03/2017, 11:23:26: Alex Brown: Its protected
16/03/2017, 11:23:36: sil: are the cobwebs gonna slow the gears?
16/03/2017, 11:23:38: Rich: Don't worry sil he'll take it apart to fix it before the ride
16/03/2017, 11:23:43: Rich: Right before the ride
16/03/2017, 11:23:53: Rich: And paint it bad ass gangster golf
16/03/2017, 11:23:56: Rich: Gold
16/03/2017, 11:23:57: sil: yiu know what. he will literally have to do that
16/03/2017, 11:24:26: Rich: Hey if you bring your foldy back he could ride your dads bike and you can ride the foldy
16/03/2017, 11:24:23: sil: he has no tires as I remember
16/03/2017, 11:24:39: Rich: He had a spare set
16/03/2017, 11:24:46: Rich: I'm gonna buy some inner tubes
16/03/2017, 11:25:11: sil: my dad's bike is VERY EXPENSIVE
16/03/2017, 11:27:52: sil: <‎image omitted>
16/03/2017, 11:28:05: Alex Brown: Its ok I understand you feel inadequate next to my extreme fittness
16/03/2017, 11:28:32: sil: funny how your fitness wobbles in the wind as you ride
16/03/2017, 11:30:54: Alex Brown: I have an expensive bike
16/03/2017, 11:31:03: Alex Brown: Ive done bikes now
16/03/2017, 11:33:08: Alex Brown: Im too fast for bikes
16/03/2017, 11:34:06: sil: bet you'll bring a motorbike on one of these trips when yiur middle aged and fat
16/03/2017, 11:34:11: sil: fatter*
16/03/2017, 11:35:52: Alex Brown: I wont need to fold it
16/03/2017, 12:41:03: Alex Brown: You havent seen me in a month
16/03/2017, 12:41:13: Alex Brown: Im acctually really fit now
16/03/2017, 12:41:36: Alex Brown: Rich saw me the other day and I could see the fear in his eyes
16/03/2017, 12:41:50: sil: <‎image omitted>
16/03/2017, 12:41:53: Alex Brown: Fitness fear
16/03/2017, 12:42:11: Alex Brown: Wtf
16/03/2017, 12:42:30: sil: hahaha
16/03/2017, 12:42:33: Alex Brown: Sabotaged by my own girlfriend
16/03/2017, 12:42:43: sil: lul
16/03/2017, 12:42:52: sil: animal autistic mayonnaise eater
16/03/2017, 12:43:02: Alex Brown: It was ultra light
16/03/2017, 12:43:19: sil: not sure I believe you
16/03/2017, 12:45:12: sil: you wouldn't eat light mayo unless you had no choice
16/03/2017, 12:47:08: Alex Brown: I eat light mayo during the week
16/03/2017, 12:47:21: Alex Brown: That was full fat it was weekend
16/03/2017, 12:48:23: Alex Brown: Nicola decided to yell at me  because supposedly cats dont eat mayo
16/03/2017, 12:48:28: Alex Brown: Shit cat
16/03/2017, 12:49:07: sil: animal autistic
16/03/2017, 12:52:58: Alex Brown: Nicola also fears my immense fitness
16/03/2017, 12:54:30: sil: I'm pretty scared to be honest. Maybe now your so fit i won't be able to kick your ass in a fight as usual
16/03/2017, 12:58:17: Alex Brown: Would you fuck
16/03/2017, 12:58:40: Alex Brown: You hit me and ran away all night if I remember
16/03/2017, 12:58:48: Alex Brown: Sounds gay to me
16/03/2017, 12:59:59: Alex Brown: Probably fearing my immense fitness
16/03/2017, 13:00:12: Alex Brown: Well see come cycle day
16/03/2017, 13:00:49: Alex Brown: I might just hadicap my bike by fixing it badly on purpose
16/03/2017, 13:01:12: Alex Brown: I dont want my sport prowess to be the cause of tears
16/03/2017, 13:03:20: sil: yeah you will be miles ahead. Unless you get an injury that slows you down a few days before the ride. but that'd be super bad luck and unlikely to happen.
16/03/2017, 13:08:36: sil: like, what if you pull a muscle while training in be gym a week before?
or you have a bad cold the day of the ride?
or you damage your foot?
16/03/2017, 13:09:00: sil: usually your a man of peak physical condition
16/03/2017, 13:13:03: sil: just promise you'll help me when I can't get my bike over a basic fence style yeah?
16/03/2017, 13:19:11: Alex Brown: Hmm that wont happen
16/03/2017, 13:19:57: Alex Brown: Wht im gonna do is purposefully hang out at the back of the group and walk my bike up the big hills
16/03/2017, 13:20:25: sil: to make us feel good about our selves?
your so kind Alex
16/03/2017, 13:20:29: Alex Brown: I dont want to upset both of you by training with an athlete at the top of his game
16/03/2017, 13:21:21: Alex Brown: I know rich especially will be upset
16/03/2017, 13:21:36: Alex Brown: Because he thinks biking is his thing
16/03/2017, 13:21:50: sil: we cycled before Rich Alex
16/03/2017, 13:22:06: sil: this was our thing.
16/03/2017, 13:22:07: Alex Brown: I know
16/03/2017, 13:22:25: Alex Brown: We did alot of things before rich
16/03/2017, 13:23:09: Alex Brown: Like enjoying finer foods
16/03/2017, 13:23:22: sil: rich hasn't caught up with that yet
16/03/2017, 13:23:35: Alex Brown: Were just more mentally developed
16/03/2017, 13:23:54: sil: I can't deny that at all. That's very true
16/03/2017, 13:24:19: Alex Brown: Its difficult for rich as he has to undo years of plebdom
16/03/2017, 13:24:57: sil: he makes curry and pasta from the jar......
16/03/2017, 13:24:58: sil: ew
16/03/2017, 13:25:08: Alex Brown: Moving to london was good for him
16/03/2017, 13:25:23: Alex Brown: But he still puts lettuce in pasta
16/03/2017, 13:25:34: sil: .....utter plebdom
16/03/2017, 13:25:44: sil: at least he gets his greens
16/03/2017, 13:25:53: sil: in the most plebby way
16/03/2017, 13:26:20: sil: it's good picking on the one who isn't here. he can't defend himself
16/03/2017, 13:26:48: Alex Brown: He probably is making tuna mayo sandwiches right now
16/03/2017, 13:26:58: Alex Brown: And listening to radio 2
16/03/2017, 13:27:35: sil: tuna is one of the worst things you can eat
16/03/2017, 13:27:43: sil: and very bad for the ocean
16/03/2017, 13:28:08: sil: so all his liberal ideals are eroded by tuna eating
16/03/2017, 13:28:18: Alex Brown: I forgot you dont like fish
16/03/2017, 13:28:26: Alex Brown: Pretty plebby also
16/03/2017, 13:30:16: sil: says the man who licks plates clean
16/03/2017, 13:30:54: Alex Brown: Not being wasteful is different
16/03/2017, 13:31:06: Alex Brown: I know the value of money
16/03/2017, 13:31:15: sil: says the man who throws coins in the bin
16/03/2017, 13:31:30: Alex Brown: Useless pennies!?
16/03/2017, 13:31:38: Alex Brown: Thats not money
16/03/2017, 13:32:10: Alex Brown: I wouldnt be seen with change
16/03/2017, 13:32:39: sil: you are both a pleb and a snob

I think Alex is actual really cool and all this time I've secretly thought we was the fittest and most logical out of us all. also the only reason I've ever said Alex was animal autistic was out of jealousy that he truly seems to have a real connection with animals

04/04/2017, 08:44:28: Rich: Yeah I don't think begging is a fun way to make that wage
04/04/2017, 08:50:11: sil: I like how no one has considered how he may have mental health issues

10/04/2017, 10:03:23: Rich: If we cycle he has an even bigger advantage
10/04/2017, 10:03:49: sil: We could drive to Alverley if you wanna be a bit lazy. But seeming as we will have to wait for Alex anyway might as well use that time to cycle
10/04/2017, 10:04:01: Rich: Yeah
10/04/2017, 10:04:15: Rich: Either way we have to cycle back as I'm sure we'll be quite drunk

12/04/2017, 13:54:00: sil: I'm easy. Whatever results I'm us having to wait for Alex the least is the day I'm behind
12/04/2017, 13:54:14: sil: In*

12/04/2017, 13:59:28: sil: It's a bit of a strange route to go clav to Alveley to kinver
12/04/2017, 13:59:37: Rich: I guess if we start Saturday alex can bring his stuff to claverley and stay over Friday evening
12/04/2017, 14:05:46: sil: <‎image omitted>

12/04/2017, 14:09:17: sil: Oh I see. You've left out Alveley
12/04/2017, 14:09:49: sil: We will be starting heath tonight though

12/04/2017, 14:10:40: Rich: seems nice
12/04/2017, 14:11:16: sil: Yeah looks good. Kind of a shame we have to come back on selves tho
12/04/2017, 14:11:17: Rich: if we hit the cat inn first we can do a better route:

12/04/2017, 14:11:54: Rich: actually, we should do it in reverse
12/04/2017, 14:12:09: Rich: that way we cycle the furthest whilst sober and we won't be super drunk cycling in urban areas
12/04/2017, 14:12:15: sil: Yes I like that
12/04/2017, 14:12:39: sil: We will have to have 1 drink per pub to make time
12/04/2017, 14:13:16: Rich: 6 pubs 6 pints
12/04/2017, 14:13:25: sil: 6? Hmm

16/04/2017, 12:42:09: Rich: Had to drunkenly pull it out and then cruise down hills again
16/04/2017, 12:43:32: sil: Ah wut. How did that happen? 
Did it bend off?
16/04/2017, 12:44:37: Rich: Maybe it got damaged when the chain broke? I changed gear going up the sandstone cut in and crunched to a halt
16/04/2017, 12:45:41: sil: Maybe it wasn't aligned properly before? 
Could have been why the chain broke?
16/04/2017, 12:46:16: Rich: Dunno I looked before we started and it was pretty straight.
16/04/2017, 12:46:26: Rich: Think the chain needed replacing anyway
16/04/2017, 16:49:47: Rich: What you guys doing tonight?

17/04/2017, 22:10:41: sil: Is that the same pan guy?
17/04/2017, 22:11:25: Rich: Where's that from?
17/04/2017, 22:30:11: Alex Brown: My bros work in the 90s
17/04/2017, 22:30:15: Alex Brown: His boss
17/04/2017, 22:30:43: Rich: Ha
17/04/2017, 22:33:06: sil: Guess smoking in bathrooms was a thing in the 90's
17/04/2017, 22:36:16: Alex Brown: Yeh would have been
17/04/2017, 22:37:00: Alex Brown: Would be on the factory floor with petrol so suppose toilets were safe
20/04/2017, 18:25:41: Alex Brown: https://www.istructe.org/about-us/funds-and-donations/educational-trust/the-young-structural-engineers-international
20/04/2017, 18:25:46: Alex Brown: Pdf in there
20/04/2017, 18:36:31: Alex Brown: Sounds huge
20/04/2017, 18:37:08: Alex Brown: We could do a death star
20/04/2017, 19:01:08: Rich: it's got to generate gravity ergo it has to be a very rapidly spinning death star
20/04/2017, 19:01:27: Alex Brown: Exactly
20/04/2017, 19:01:50: Alex Brown: A large disk/ multiple discs
20/04/2017, 19:01:58: Alex Brown: Connected
20/04/2017, 19:02:17: Alex Brown: With a central power axel
20/04/2017, 19:04:21: Alex Brown: How would you dock space ships on a spinning object though
20/04/2017, 19:04:38: Alex Brown: They would have to circle at the same speed
20/04/2017, 19:05:22: Alex Brown: Unless they go through the axel
20/04/2017, 19:08:10: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
20/04/2017, 19:10:23: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
20/04/2017, 19:10:54: Alex Brown: That basically
20/04/2017, 19:13:31: Rich: Centre of axel I guess. Or an independent wheel that can be slowed down in preparation for doling
20/04/2017, 19:13:35: Rich: Docking
20/04/2017, 19:18:07: Rich: The pain of this project is that we'd have to read a bunch of papers
20/04/2017, 19:18:16: Rich: Reading papers is interesting but very time consuming
20/04/2017, 19:18:53: Alex Brown: Yes it is
20/04/2017, 19:21:36: Rich: You could have fixed length sections of bound carbon nanotube that can be connected at the end to bend into circular structures of variable size
20/04/2017, 19:22:01: Rich: And then start them spinning to put them under tension before adding additional structure
20/04/2017, 19:22:21: Rich: That way you could add them modularly and create rings of different lengths
20/04/2017, 19:22:44: Rich: They'd be light and strong and take advantage of the gravity generating rotation
20/04/2017, 19:23:23: Alex Brown: Hmm carbon nanotubes sounds out of engineering scope
20/04/2017, 19:23:38: Alex Brown: Very difficult to design
20/04/2017, 19:23:45: Alex Brown: Alluminium??
20/04/2017, 19:26:05: Alex Brown: They would also be unfeasible
20/04/2017, 19:28:16: Alex Brown: High garde steel or alluminium are designable
20/04/2017, 19:29:05: Rich: Aluminium is old
20/04/2017, 19:29:11: Rich: Carbon nanotubes are novel
20/04/2017, 19:29:41: Rich: Also super strong and all the stress would be radial resolved as tension along the tubes
20/04/2017, 19:29:46: Rich: Very simple to calculate
20/04/2017, 19:29:52: Rich: So much symmetry
20/04/2017, 19:30:12: Alex Brown: Its too theoretical
20/04/2017, 19:30:25: Alex Brown: To put into a design
20/04/2017, 19:31:20: Rich: It's supposed to be theoretical
20/04/2017, 19:32:44: Alex Brown: Its also an engineering competition which means it needs to be designable with calculations
20/04/2017, 19:33:10: Rich: This is designable
20/04/2017, 19:33:09: Alex Brown: With preliminary sizing
20/04/2017, 19:33:25: Rich: You just need to figure out how to connect the sections and we're done
20/04/2017, 19:33:54: Alex Brown: Strength of beams made from carbon nano tubes sounds solid
20/04/2017, 19:37:30: Alex Brown: Very high grade lightweight steel capsules connected together
20/04/2017, 20:04:54: Rich: Steel capsules hooked to carbon nanotubes
20/04/2017, 20:14:54: Alex Brown: Yes that will do
21/04/2017, 11:46:56: ‎sil changed this group's icon

21/04/2017, 11:57:36: Rich: 2 + 2 and all that
21/04/2017, 12:29:20: sil: We will put some revision at the top of a wall for you
21/04/2017, 12:29:28: sil: Climb to get it
21/04/2017, 12:51:21: Rich: Alex weighs 100kg and dan weights 80kg. If dan can climb 10m up a wall, but alex can only climb 2m who will have the most hench body?
21/04/2017, 13:13:25: sil: *knock knock*

26/04/2017, 23:08:05: Alex Brown: We should see Adam at some point
26/04/2017, 23:08:15: sil: I saw Adam yesterday
26/04/2017, 23:08:31: sil: Actually no. It was Sunday
26/04/2017, 23:08:39: Alex Brown: Bad man
26/04/2017, 23:09:05: sil: He's going on a stag do next week or something
26/04/2017, 23:09:12: Alex Brown: Haven't seen the both of you together since day mate
26/04/2017, 23:09:19: sil: So he's not around one of the weekends
26/04/2017, 23:09:21: Alex Brown: Makes sense
26/04/2017, 23:09:32: Alex Brown: Ben half called me the other day
26/04/2017, 23:09:44: Alex Brown: I think we should go for his stag
26/04/2017, 23:09:53: sil: Shit I keep forgetting
26/04/2017, 23:09:58: Alex Brown: U drive to shrops I'll head to scotts
26/04/2017, 23:10:21: Alex Brown: We should really do it
26/04/2017, 23:10:26: sil: Yeah
26/04/2017, 23:10:34: Alex Brown: And yes to camping after the wedding
26/04/2017, 23:10:40: sil: Gotta keep it cheap though. Ive got a lot of stuff on
26/04/2017, 23:10:57: sil: Got another wedding to go to, a holiday and other shit that costs
26/04/2017, 23:11:00: Alex Brown: It holiday I don't wanna sacrifice
26/04/2017, 23:11:14: sil: Yeah same. I've already booked a lot ofd
26/04/2017, 23:11:18: Alex Brown: We should do it tho
26/04/2017, 23:11:22: Alex Brown: It is ben
26/04/2017, 23:11:40: sil: Yeah I know. Well let's plan it next weekend
26/04/2017, 23:12:14: sil: I just wanna do which ever is cheapest and quickest so I can take least time off for least expense
26/04/2017, 23:12:36: sil: Which is probs driving
26/04/2017, 23:15:41: Alex Brown: I think so plane is dear
26/04/2017, 23:16:30: sil: We can slog it. Driving will cost a tank each
26/04/2017, 23:16:40: sil: So like £50 return
26/04/2017, 23:17:02: sil: Maybe a bit more
26/04/2017, 23:17:36: sil: We could always see who else is driving?
26/04/2017, 23:18:05: sil: Might be able to blag lift on the group? 
But could be awkward with randomers
26/04/2017, 23:22:12: Alex Brown: It's very long for a weekend tho
26/04/2017, 23:22:43: Alex Brown: It's an hour by plane and infinitely easier
26/04/2017, 23:23:10: sil: Hm
26/04/2017, 23:41:44: Alex Brown: I've done it a few times now and it's worth the money
27/04/2017, 08:03:01: sil: How's your new phone treating you Alex?
27/04/2017, 08:17:09: Alex Brown: Yeah it's great
27/04/2017, 08:17:24: Alex Brown: Bittorrentong bare shit in hd
27/04/2017, 08:17:46: Alex Brown: The keyboard is annoying
27/04/2017, 08:23:45: sil: Badman. 
Down SwiftKey
27/04/2017, 08:24:08: sil: It's a bit better, more customisable
27/04/2017, 08:24:09: sil: Ask zack for his android tips. He's modded his to the extreme
27/04/2017, 10:11:16: sil: Download some icon packs

29/04/2017, 20:11:01: Alex Brown: It was a hundred for the kit
29/04/2017, 20:11:14: Alex Brown: The jet to go in it is a hundred
29/04/2017, 20:11:55: Alex Brown: Add remote control servos and catapult lift off gear it could reach 400
29/04/2017, 20:12:05: Alex Brown: Expensive kindling

01/05/2017, 22:03:30: sil: That's a kit Alex. You put it together. Way cooler project
01/05/2017, 22:03:47: sil: And you get an actual boat at the end!
01/05/2017, 22:56:31: Alex Brown: Yeh is love to do that
01/05/2017, 22:56:49: Alex Brown: But I live in a small flat in london
01/05/2017, 22:56:59: Alex Brown: Hence the scale building
01/05/2017, 22:57:42: Alex Brown: It's the only thing I can get away with building at I'm still being moned at for it
01/05/2017, 22:58:01: Alex Brown: At the flat
01/05/2017, 23:07:50: sil: Hmm. I guess we could try sitting on your toy boat one at a time
01/05/2017, 23:09:52: Alex Brown: I think it's gonna be fun
01/05/2017, 23:10:41: Alex Brown: Can take it to all the model boat lakes in london and break all the lame nerds steam boats
01/05/2017, 23:28:08: sil: It's only cool of you put a gun of it

02/05/2017, 09:35:15: sil: Rich, wanna build a real boat and leave Alex on shore with his kids toy?
02/05/2017, 09:36:15: sil: http://aquascene.co.uk/shop-kayaks/4556561216/tahiti-plus/248880
02/05/2017, 09:36:59: sil: Look at that boat. 3 person inflatable kayak. Actually a good price. We could finally do our river Severn trip
02/05/2017, 09:38:02: sil: And it's inflatable so we can put it in a  car and travel with it
02/05/2017, 09:38:15: sil: I'm not even joking any more
02/05/2017, 11:39:27: sil: https://www.outdoorxl.co.uk/sevylor-adventure-plus.html?kw=&gclid=CjwKEAjw3KDIBRCz0KvZlJ7k4TgSJABDqOK7KkujNAAspM6LQYPe5lJMpsfC9ByBWRxxRBB10k3dHBoC0g3w_wcB
02/05/2017, 11:39:37: sil: If we spend more. But harder to transport
02/05/2017, 11:41:44: sil: It would be so good. Tent in waterproof bag, start in Bridgnorth. Pull up on side of river and camp any where
02/05/2017, 11:42:09: sil: Then sail away in the morning!
02/05/2017, 11:44:40: Rich: Yeah I do
02/05/2017, 11:45:01: Rich: <‎image omitted>
02/05/2017, 11:45:07: sil: You do?
02/05/2017, 11:45:51: sil: Stop glossing over the boat trip.
02/05/2017, 11:46:11: Rich: YeAh I do
02/05/2017, 11:46:16: Rich: Sorry I'm busy holidaying
02/05/2017, 11:55:00: sil: Check out the boats
02/05/2017, 11:56:07: sil: Inflatable one, 3 man. 
Could finally do River Severn by kayak. 
Park one car further up river and one car towards Bristol way
02/05/2017, 11:58:12: Rich: Yeah that would be cool
02/05/2017, 11:58:20: Rich: We'd need life jackets
02/05/2017, 12:05:55: sil: Yeah totally. 
We could rent them pretty easy I Recon
02/05/2017, 12:06:14: sil: We would need life jackets and oars. 
Which we can either buy or rent
02/05/2017, 12:07:21: sil: Imagine all the riverside pubs we could stop at!
02/05/2017, 12:08:35: Rich: It would be pretty awesome
02/05/2017, 12:08:44: Rich: We need to make sure it can handle rapids too
02/05/2017, 12:08:58: Rich: We don't want our boat breaking by arley
02/05/2017, 12:09:38: sil: As long as we have life jackets and keep alert.
And also take a puncture repair kit!
02/05/2017, 12:16:15: Rich: I guess the boat comes
With one, but if we reach that point we're probably fucked
02/05/2017, 12:17:23: sil: Itl be thick rubber I reckon. It's a proper boat by the looks of it. Not just a pool toy
02/05/2017, 12:18:24: sil: It would be pretty awesome. Dreamed of this trip for a while. Would have to get lots of waterproof bags
02/05/2017, 12:22:30: sil: Or we could just by a toy boat. And play with it in a park for 10mins
02/05/2017, 12:29:04: Rich: LoL

02/05/2017, 12:37:01: Rich: Bargain
02/05/2017, 12:37:08: Rich: We can do a practice run up the lee
02/05/2017, 12:37:34: sil: Yeah totally. Split between 3 people I think that's a good price
02/05/2017, 12:41:38: Rich: Yeah
02/05/2017, 12:42:04: Rich: <‎image omitted>
02/05/2017, 12:59:28: sil: How about I just write a few messages

02/05/2017, 13:00:01: sil: Alex will never see this hilarious picture of your rich
02/05/2017, 13:00:30: sil: Your holiday snap will remain unapreciated

02/05/2017, 16:01:24: sil: Just realised doing a boat trip in one boat eliminates all competition. Alex won't be able to lose as usual
02/05/2017, 16:01:41: sil: I guess we can still row better than Alex
02/05/2017, 16:38:11: Rich: We'll be carrying him I suppose
02/05/2017, 16:38:18: Rich: With our hench climbing muscles
