28/06/2017, 21:13:33: Alex Brown: Many
28/06/2017, 21:23:42: Rich: I'm not taking Tuesday off
28/06/2017, 21:23:57: Rich: It's 124 miles on the recommended route
28/06/2017, 21:24:03: Alex Brown: You don't have a job
28/06/2017, 21:24:16: Alex Brown: Be a bad a
28/06/2017, 21:24:21: Alex Brown: Mon
28/06/2017, 21:24:34: Alex Brown: We only do it once a year
28/06/2017, 21:29:21: sil: Yeah I'm also not taking Tues off
28/06/2017, 21:29:58: Rich: You're very brave about the distances you can cycle except when you're actually cycling them
28/06/2017, 21:30:31: sil: But also I agree wash lame finish point
28/06/2017, 21:30:47: Rich: I'm happy to get drunk. I think it would be beautiful
28/06/2017, 21:30:51: Rich: I'd like to see the ocean
28/06/2017, 21:31:03: Rich: I can't see a better seaside town up there to go to
28/06/2017, 21:31:25: Alex Brown: Let's head to southwald
28/06/2017, 21:31:26: sil: Norwich or Cambridge would be best place to end up
28/06/2017, 21:31:35: Alex Brown: Where the Adams brewery is
28/06/2017, 21:32:10: Rich: Cambridge is too close really
28/06/2017, 21:32:25: Rich: We could do Norwich is alex trained really hard...
28/06/2017, 21:32:36: sil: Yeah it is. But we could end there is we did more of a loop
28/06/2017, 21:32:46: sil: But whatever
28/06/2017, 21:33:12: Rich: Southwold is doable if we don't got to Cambridge
28/06/2017, 21:34:15: Alex Brown: Yeh
28/06/2017, 21:34:25: Alex Brown: That was the original
28/06/2017, 21:34:34: Alex Brown: Suggestion
28/06/2017, 21:34:36: Rich: Actually as soon as you avoid a roads the distance goes up to 125
28/06/2017, 21:34:56: Alex Brown: Stop being a puss rich
28/06/2017, 21:34:58: sil: Surly it's not much closer than Norwich
28/06/2017, 21:35:17: Rich: Also we'd have to get a bus to the train
28/06/2017, 21:35:24: Rich: It's a four hour journey home
28/06/2017, 21:35:30: Alex Brown: Yeh
28/06/2017, 21:35:36: Alex Brown: That's a point
28/06/2017, 21:35:43: Rich: Whereas kings lynn is 2 hour
28/06/2017, 21:35:46: Alex Brown: I'm down for norwich
28/06/2017, 21:35:55: Rich: And Norwich is 3
28/06/2017, 21:36:00: Rich: You'd better get training then
28/06/2017, 21:36:04: sil: Yeah but we have to cycle from the wash to Kings Lynn
28/06/2017, 21:36:11: sil: To get a train
28/06/2017, 21:36:12: Rich: It's only like a mile
28/06/2017, 21:36:20: Rich: It's just to go past and actually see it
28/06/2017, 21:36:40: sil: Kings Lynn is a crap town
28/06/2017, 21:36:43: Rich: I'm happy with the ocean anywhere but kings lynn takes us past cambridge and is reachable along not main roads
28/06/2017, 21:36:46: Rich: I don't really mind
28/06/2017, 21:36:47: Alex Brown: Erm Norwich is boss
28/06/2017, 21:37:37: Alex Brown: I think Kings Lynn will be gay
28/06/2017, 21:37:47: Alex Brown: Norwich looks nice
28/06/2017, 21:37:54: Alex Brown: And full of pubs
28/06/2017, 21:37:57: Rich: Ok let's do Norwich
28/06/2017, 21:38:05: sil: Even has a place in urban dictionary as the definition  of shit Town
28/06/2017, 21:38:07: sil: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3DKing%2527s%2520Lynn%26amp%3Dtrue
28/06/2017, 21:38:08: Rich: In three days
28/06/2017, 21:38:10: Alex Brown: I'm up for taking Tuesday to do it
28/06/2017, 21:38:14: Rich: I'm not
28/06/2017, 21:38:22: Alex Brown: Why not
28/06/2017, 21:38:26: Rich: I'm up for seeing you suffer though
28/06/2017, 21:38:29: Alex Brown: I don't get it
28/06/2017, 21:38:40: Alex Brown: It's late summer
28/06/2017, 21:38:42: sil: I don't wanna take any more holiday time
28/06/2017, 21:38:44: Rich: Because I have a shit ton of work to do and I'm already taking loads of holiday in august
28/06/2017, 21:38:48: Alex Brown: Take a day off
28/06/2017, 21:39:08: Alex Brown: Just take a dayoff
28/06/2017, 21:39:15: sil: I'm with rich. 
3 day trip is standard and usually fine
28/06/2017, 21:39:18: Alex Brown: Surely you have a day
28/06/2017, 21:39:33: Alex Brown: Ok but let's go Fri night then
28/06/2017, 21:39:43: sil: After work?
28/06/2017, 21:39:50: Alex Brown: Yah mon
28/06/2017, 21:39:53: sil: We wouldnt get far. What would be there Pont
28/06/2017, 21:39:56: Alex Brown: I'll leave early
28/06/2017, 21:40:21: Alex Brown: We can camp in epping forest and get raped
28/06/2017, 21:40:43: sil: Epping forest is pretty busy with dog walkers
28/06/2017, 21:40:55: Alex Brown: And bum rapists
28/06/2017, 21:41:00: Alex Brown: I'm sold lads
28/06/2017, 21:41:04: sil: We would have to get past m25 on first day to camp
28/06/2017, 21:41:33: Alex Brown: The roads out of London will be fast
28/06/2017, 21:41:46: Alex Brown: Big main roads
28/06/2017, 21:43:54: Rich: I think Epping forest is probably our best bet for camping
28/06/2017, 21:44:01: Rich: People camp there anyway I think
28/06/2017, 21:44:13: Rich: We'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else if we leave in the evening
28/06/2017, 21:44:13: sil: The homeless do, yes
28/06/2017, 21:44:20: Rich: Yeah that's fine then
28/06/2017, 21:44:28: sil: We should leave sat morn
28/06/2017, 21:44:38: Rich: Yeah that's sensible
28/06/2017, 21:44:41: Alex Brown: Yeh I do agree looking from above
28/06/2017, 21:44:42: sil: Get distance. Outside Cambridge is very rural
28/06/2017, 21:44:49: Rich: We'll just have to cover a lot of ground
28/06/2017, 21:45:00: Rich: Which I'm happy to do
28/06/2017, 21:45:40: sil: We cycle up Lea Valley towards Cambridge Countryside
28/06/2017, 21:46:25: sil: We will need the Friday to prepare
28/06/2017, 21:46:35: sil: Get stuff ready in the morning. Alex will need to fix his bike
28/06/2017, 21:47:10: sil: Who are you kidding Alex. How you think you'll be ready by Friday after work?
28/06/2017, 21:47:29: Alex Brown: Preperation
28/06/2017, 21:47:43: sil: When will you prepare?
28/06/2017, 21:47:53: Alex Brown: Something you don't understand
28/06/2017, 21:47:59: Alex Brown: Weekend before
28/06/2017, 21:48:01: Alex Brown: Obvs
28/06/2017, 21:48:51: sil: Me and rich are going to organise this in a private chat. We will send you an invite with the itinary
28/06/2017, 21:49:31: James: <‎image omitted>
28/06/2017, 21:50:39: Alex Brown: Lame
28/06/2017, 21:51:20: Alex Brown: I'm gonna be in a tent with james
28/06/2017, 21:51:20: Alex Brown: You gonna miss my hard touch rich?
28/06/2017, 21:51:48: sil: We will inform you of departure time and give you some info regarding where we are going to visit. Please send any 'suggestions' in an email please.
28/06/2017, 21:53:30: James: Hope you guys bring road  worthy bikes this time 😆
28/06/2017, 21:53:34: Alex Brown: Rich get an actual bike not a piece of Chinese crap
28/06/2017, 21:54:56: Alex Brown: Your last two have been from whang-dong Chine
28/06/2017, 21:56:32: sil: Please send these recommendations to rich_&_sils_bikeride@yahoo.com
28/06/2017, 21:57:29: Alex Brown: It's gonna be a festival of shit bikes then
28/06/2017, 21:58:02: sil: We will try to read as many as we can. However, if you recieve no response in 10 days, apologies your suggestion has been rejected.
28/06/2017, 22:13:17: Rich: Everyone should stay here on the Friday night
28/06/2017, 22:13:24: Rich: That way we can start early
28/06/2017, 22:19:02: James: Are we not leaving on Friday night?
28/06/2017, 22:20:10: Rich: I think we'd end struggle to find somewhere to camp, else end up in Epping forest like half an hour from home
28/06/2017, 22:20:17: Rich: It would be going dark when we left
28/06/2017, 22:21:46: James: One sec - scavenging a pannier from bin store
28/06/2017, 22:21:55: Rich: Haha nice
28/06/2017, 22:22:08: Rich: Are there decent ones? They're pretty expensive
28/06/2017, 22:22:23: sil: I need a bike
28/06/2017, 22:23:45: Rich: you have a bike!
28/06/2017, 22:23:52: James: How about this one?
28/06/2017, 22:23:56: sil: Still hoping to borrow tashs
28/06/2017, 22:23:59: sil: I might ask her
28/06/2017, 22:24:10: Rich: Both our previous rides were 70 miles direct
28/06/2017, 22:24:10: James: <‎image omitted>
28/06/2017, 22:24:27: Rich: So this one will be challenging.
28/06/2017, 22:25:10: sil: I've looked for bike rental in London but its all stupid expensive like day rates for city cycling
28/06/2017, 22:25:34: Rich: She's not sure because she's only just been able to start cycling again
28/06/2017, 22:26:14: sil: Yeah I didn't imagine she would trust a bunch of boys with her bike
28/06/2017, 22:26:24: James: <‎image omitted>
28/06/2017, 22:26:41: sil: That is a problem tho. Loom out for any decent bike rental places
28/06/2017, 22:26:44: Rich: Yeah ride alex
28/06/2017, 22:27:00: Rich: You could buy one like tashs on gum tree for like £100
28/06/2017, 22:27:04: James: Dishwasher is complementary
28/06/2017, 22:27:20: sil: Nah I don't want to buy one
28/06/2017, 22:27:26: sil: Especially not a shit one
28/06/2017, 22:27:34: sil: I havnt got space
28/06/2017, 22:27:49: Rich: If we're riding twice the distance as usual with a potentially salvaged bike then I'm not sure how likely we are to make it
28/06/2017, 22:28:09: Rich: I guess if it's a shit one you can
Always lock it up outside
28/06/2017, 22:28:35: sil: I'm not gonna buy one
28/06/2017, 23:24:57: Alex Brown: Why don't you get an actual bike Instead of a foldable pile of wank
28/06/2017, 23:26:03: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
28/06/2017, 23:26:12: Alex Brown: = no use
28/06/2017, 23:26:20: Alex Brown: = useless
28/06/2017, 23:26:50: Alex Brown: = fucking gay as fuck
28/06/2017, 23:27:51: Alex Brown: Why don't you sell that gay pile of fuck and buy a useful bike?
28/06/2017, 23:28:56: Alex Brown: Rather than a useless pile of gay shit
29/06/2017, 00:03:57: Alex Brown: Look at that for a free piece of shit
29/06/2017, 00:04:04: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
29/06/2017, 08:06:27: Rich: Nice. Did you find bags for it?
29/06/2017, 08:06:33: Rich: Norwich is way too far away
29/06/2017, 08:45:13: sil: Francis too far
29/06/2017, 08:49:11: Alex Brown: France is far
29/06/2017, 12:12:13: sil: Maybe we shouldnt do a bike trip and do a drive trip instead
29/06/2017, 12:12:19: sil: Drive to Norwich
29/06/2017, 12:17:42: Rich: I <3 motorways
29/06/2017, 12:17:53: Rich: I do think we should be realistic though
29/06/2017, 12:18:14: Rich: If you compare the distance to Norwich on google maps to our previous rides it is much further
29/06/2017, 12:18:51: Rich: If anyone's bike breaks or one of us slows the group down by being really fit we wouldn't make it
29/06/2017, 12:19:19: James: There's no motorway to Norwich....
29/06/2017, 12:19:38: James: ..but the A12 is lovely!
29/06/2017, 12:20:17: sil: I was thinking we could just drive down B-roads
29/06/2017, 12:20:44: sil: And stop off at pubs along the way
29/06/2017, 12:21:14: James: Are you volunteering to be designated driver?
29/06/2017, 12:21:28: James: 😆
29/06/2017, 12:21:42: sil: Alex mentioned he would drive
29/06/2017, 12:21:57: James: Sweet, nice one Alex.
29/06/2017, 12:22:04: Rich: Great
29/06/2017, 12:22:28: sil: Seeming as he hasn't given any of us a lift anywhere in about a year
29/06/2017, 12:22:33: sil: Very kind of him
29/06/2017, 12:37:23: Alex Brown: Peasants drive
29/06/2017, 12:37:33: Alex Brown: I prefer to be driven
29/06/2017, 12:41:39: sil: Alex, do you need to get ur bike from home?
29/06/2017, 12:42:44: sil: /how are you getting your bike from home?
29/06/2017, 12:43:37: Rich: we could do harwick:
29/06/2017, 12:44:22: sil: Where is that?

29/06/2017, 12:45:18: Rich: southwald is probably a nicer ride:

29/06/2017, 12:45:27: Rich: but the journey home would be horrendous
29/06/2017, 12:45:44: sil: Next to Clacton on sea
29/06/2017, 12:45:57: sil: Loverly deprived area
29/06/2017, 12:46:02: Rich: thing is Clacton is a bit close
29/06/2017, 12:46:10: Rich: yeah I imagine it's the shit outside of london
29/06/2017, 12:46:16: sil: How about margate?
29/06/2017, 12:46:35: sil: Although I just went there last weekend
29/06/2017, 12:47:13: sil: But if we can do a coastal route, that'd be cool. And places like Whitstable are on the way and on coast. All nice places
29/06/2017, 12:47:25: Rich: yeah that might be an idea
29/06/2017, 12:47:36: Rich: we could do southwold and cycle to a town with a station:

29/06/2017, 12:48:21: Rich: oh shit actually it would be an extra 9 miles to get to the station
29/06/2017, 12:48:21: James: Very good seafood in Whitstable, "beach" is shit though.
29/06/2017, 12:48:38: sil: Margate beach is decent
29/06/2017, 12:48:41: sil: Actual sand
29/06/2017, 12:48:57: sil: Whitstable has good pubs and food
29/06/2017, 12:49:00: Rich: I feel like if we went that way we'd spend loads of time in London, outskirts, near main road
29/06/2017, 12:49:11: Rich: it's about the journey not the destination
29/06/2017, 12:49:18: sil: Yeah that's the only thing.  Unless you can identify a route
29/06/2017, 12:49:21: Rich: also I'm guessing it's fairly densely populated making camping difficult
29/06/2017, 12:49:33: sil: I camped this weekend
29/06/2017, 12:49:43: sil: Outside of margate
29/06/2017, 12:49:55: Rich: illegally?
29/06/2017, 12:50:14: Rich: I'm coming round to southwold
29/06/2017, 12:50:16: sil: No, but it was open countryside
29/06/2017, 12:50:26: sil: Not densely populated
29/06/2017, 12:51:54: James: Southwold beach is stunning
29/06/2017, 12:52:24: James: And the pubs and food are very good
29/06/2017, 12:52:50: Rich: I think I'm casting a vote for southwold
29/06/2017, 12:54:01: sil: If you can find a good route sure. But plans should always be changeable if they are improveable. So I'm not casting a vote
29/06/2017, 13:02:59: sil: Alex do you have spare tires?
29/06/2017, 13:03:19: Alex Brown: I fancy southwald
29/06/2017, 13:03:24: sil: Just rememebed bryony brothers old bike on garden. Tires exploded buy still functional
29/06/2017, 13:03:27: Alex Brown: I have spare inners
29/06/2017, 13:03:41: sil: Hmm, needs whole tire
29/06/2017, 13:03:54: sil: As in inner and outer. Not metal
29/06/2017, 13:04:08: sil: Thought you had spare treads
29/06/2017, 13:05:30: sil: I can get treads of home. Which refers me back to my first question. How are u getting your bike from home?
29/06/2017, 13:18:08: Rich: I also have spare in need
29/06/2017, 13:18:15: Rich: Inner tubes
29/06/2017, 13:18:25: Rich: But it depends what size you need
29/06/2017, 13:18:37: Rich: Actually, let me check how many
I have
29/06/2017, 13:18:43: Rich: I'm taking at least two spares...
29/06/2017, 13:18:52: Rich: I'm going to order a chain tool now
29/06/2017, 13:24:55: Rich: I think we need one of these:

29/06/2017, 13:28:54: sil: Most important is I need tread outer tore
29/06/2017, 13:29:29: Rich: what's Bryony's brother's bike like?
29/06/2017, 13:30:27: Rich: here's a route to Southwold:

29/06/2017, 13:30:41: Alex Brown: I may go home next weekend and retrive
29/06/2017, 13:30:50: Alex Brown: Only chance I have
29/06/2017, 13:31:17: Rich: I'm going back to Shropshire in two weeks
29/06/2017, 13:31:17: Alex Brown: Then we can do curry weekend after
29/06/2017, 13:31:26: Alex Brown: Balls
29/06/2017, 13:32:06: James: You can't cycle along the A12 - that would be suicide.
29/06/2017, 13:32:17: Alex Brown: I'd hug the coast more rich
29/06/2017, 13:32:23: Alex Brown: Avoid ipswich
29/06/2017, 13:32:27: Alex Brown: As it's wank
29/06/2017, 13:32:57: Alex Brown: Yeh agree with James ban A roads unless super necessary

29/06/2017, 13:48:10: Alex Brown: Nah you just cross the A road
29/06/2017, 13:48:19: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
29/06/2017, 13:48:39: Rich: Cool
29/06/2017, 13:53:17: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
29/06/2017, 13:53:59: Alex Brown: Both your current route and the above suggested one look good
29/06/2017, 13:54:13: Rich: Looks like we'd end up a mile
Down the coast from southwold
29/06/2017, 13:54:19: Alex Brown: Just remember James saying it's really nice along that coast
29/06/2017, 13:54:32: Alex Brown: Just my shit drawing
29/06/2017, 13:55:10: Alex Brown: Roughly along that line there a quiet roads and small villages
29/06/2017, 13:56:14: James: Snape is on that route and is known as a bit of an east coast gem
29/06/2017, 13:56:52: Rich: Ok cool
29/06/2017, 13:56:52: James: Very pretty
29/06/2017, 13:57:22: Rich: I reckon we need to get past Braintree on day one
29/06/2017, 13:57:48: Rich: 40 + 35 + 35
29/06/2017, 13:57:53: Rich: It's gonna be intense
29/06/2017, 13:58:14: Alex Brown: Yeh that's why we should go Friday night to somewhere
29/06/2017, 13:58:30: Alex Brown: At least get the lame London shit out of the way
29/06/2017, 13:58:39: Alex Brown: Think that will be worth it
29/06/2017, 14:00:20: Alex Brown: We can cut ten miles off that 40
29/06/2017, 14:00:39: Alex Brown: Then have a chilling 30 mile second day piss up
29/06/2017, 14:03:08: Rich: True
29/06/2017, 14:05:18: Rich: we could cover like 12 miles and then camp in the forest:

29/06/2017, 14:05:34: Rich: if you guys got to mine at like 6:30 we could leave at 7 and pitch up camp at 8
29/06/2017, 14:12:05: sil: 6.30 am?
29/06/2017, 14:12:20: Rich: Pm
29/06/2017, 14:12:35: sil: Friday?
29/06/2017, 14:13:06: sil: I finish work at 6 and it takes me an hour + to get to yours
29/06/2017, 14:13:14: sil: Plus I'd need to get my bike
29/06/2017, 14:14:35: Rich: Hmm
29/06/2017, 14:14:51: Rich: I guess everyone could bring their bikes over before hand
29/06/2017, 14:15:01: Rich: that or we start really early Saturday
29/06/2017, 14:15:45: sil: Think it makes more sense to prep Friday, stay at yours and go 9Am
29/06/2017, 14:35:45: Alex Brown: Nah
29/06/2017, 14:35:49: Alex Brown: Friday
29/06/2017, 14:36:01: Alex Brown: 1 more night of camping
29/06/2017, 14:36:07: Alex Brown: Will be boss
29/06/2017, 14:36:24: Alex Brown: Take stuff to richs weekend before
29/06/2017, 14:36:33: Alex Brown: Prepare
29/06/2017, 14:36:43: sil: But I litrally wont have time to get to richs and get my shit from home
29/06/2017, 14:37:12: sil: Think it's better it go when we'll rested in morning
29/06/2017, 14:37:22: sil: We don't wanna camp Epping forest any way
29/06/2017, 14:37:31: sil: Need to get further than that before we camp
29/06/2017, 14:39:03: Rich: I don't mind camping in Epping but we would be pretty squeezed for time
29/06/2017, 14:39:14: Rich: It's just about getting some distance behind us really
29/06/2017, 14:39:29: sil: Yeah, I'd rather rest after work and get going in morn more refreshed
29/06/2017, 14:40:56: Rich: We could do a mega early start
29/06/2017, 14:41:04: Rich: Like 8am
29/06/2017, 14:42:47: sil: How many more miles is this trip than the last?
29/06/2017, 14:50:06: Alex Brown: Nah man
29/06/2017, 14:50:13: Alex Brown: I agree with rich
29/06/2017, 14:50:31: Rich: Mapped lanes route is 115miles
29/06/2017, 14:50:47: Rich: We usually cover just over 100
29/06/2017, 14:50:58: Rich: I can't remember exactly but alex
Has it on his moves
29/06/2017, 14:51:05: sil: Yeha we don't need to stay Friday then
29/06/2017, 14:51:06: Rich: So it's a push, but possible
29/06/2017, 14:51:18: sil: If we start sat morn we are already ahead
29/06/2017, 14:51:27: sil: We usually start sat at a out 11
29/06/2017, 14:54:52: Alex Brown: Nah sorry if we're going sat we go at 11
29/06/2017, 14:55:01: sil: Fair enough
29/06/2017, 14:55:06: Alex Brown: I'm getting sleep
29/06/2017, 14:55:13: sil: If we did it last time we can do it this time
29/06/2017, 14:55:17: sil: No need to rush
29/06/2017, 14:55:19: Alex Brown: Not starting knackered
29/06/2017, 14:55:21: Rich: Wut?
29/06/2017, 14:55:27: Alex Brown: Either camp Fri and sleep
29/06/2017, 14:55:35: Alex Brown: Or start late
29/06/2017, 14:55:46: Rich: AII
29/06/2017, 14:56:06: Alex Brown: Either way I'm not doing a 3 day bike ride after a tired week of working
29/06/2017, 14:56:12: Rich: That's silly. We need to cover a good amount of ground
29/06/2017, 14:56:16: Alex Brown: And no sleep
29/06/2017, 14:56:21: Rich: So let's compromise and leave reasonably early
29/06/2017, 14:56:24: Rich: At 9:30
29/06/2017, 14:56:26: Alex Brown: No
29/06/2017, 14:56:32: sil: Alex is making no sense
29/06/2017, 14:56:36: Rich: Yeah
29/06/2017, 14:56:50: Alex Brown: Im sleeping after mon to Fri working
29/06/2017, 14:56:54: sil: Your to positions are contradictory
29/06/2017, 14:56:57: sil: 2
29/06/2017, 14:57:04: sil: Yeha same
29/06/2017, 14:57:12: sil: That's why I wanna go sat
29/06/2017, 14:57:17: Alex Brown: Because if we get ground behind us
29/06/2017, 14:57:20: sil: Cus I'll be tired from work Friday night
29/06/2017, 14:57:21: Rich: A.I.I.
29/06/2017, 14:57:28: Alex Brown: We don't have to wake mega early sat
29/06/2017, 14:57:39: sil: But we will. Cus we are in a tent
29/06/2017, 14:57:51: sil: Why are you so thick Alex
29/06/2017, 14:58:04: Alex Brown: We can sleep early Friday night
29/06/2017, 14:58:12: Alex Brown: Don't be rude
29/06/2017, 14:58:22: sil: We will sleep early Friday night

29/06/2017, 15:00:05: Alex Brown: We can go at 10
29/06/2017, 15:00:11: Alex Brown: But no earlier
29/06/2017, 15:00:28: Alex Brown: Happy to go 6.30 Friday tho
29/06/2017, 15:00:55: sil: Alex, I finish work at 6
29/06/2017, 15:01:13: sil: It is litrally not possible for me to leave from richs 6.30
29/06/2017, 15:01:19: Rich: <‎image omitted>

30/06/2017, 12:08:24: sil: https://tours.adnams.co.uk
30/06/2017, 12:08:41: sil: I Recon we should actually book the tour for the Monday afternoon and get trashed
30/06/2017, 12:08:59: Rich: We should book it when we know what time we're going to arrive
30/06/2017, 12:09:10: Rich: But yeah that would be great
30/06/2017, 12:09:16: sil: Yeah maybe we can call ahead on the morning?
30/06/2017, 12:10:03: sil: Ah looks like last tour is always at 2pm
30/06/2017, 12:10:07: sil: A bit early
30/06/2017, 12:10:17: Rich: Yeah
30/06/2017, 12:10:30: Rich: Unless we cover some mega ground for two days
30/06/2017, 12:10:38: Rich: We need to train!
30/06/2017, 12:10:47: sil: Oh well. If we're making rediculious time we can do it
30/06/2017, 12:11:38: Rich: What's everyone training routine? I assume everyone is on a strict diet by this point
30/06/2017, 12:12:41: sil: I'm on the diet Alex was on about 3 years ago. When he ate double of everything asking as it had some protein in
30/06/2017, 12:12:54: sil: 4 fried eggs for breakfast
30/06/2017, 12:13:23: Rich: It's important to get eggs
30/06/2017, 12:14:52: James: Eggs are fine, as long as I'm not cycling downwind of any of you!
30/06/2017, 12:15:20: Rich: Don't worry I'm sure you'll be in front of alex
30/06/2017, 12:15:38: James: What do you normally do for breakfast on these trips anyways?
30/06/2017, 12:15:48: sil: Pub
30/06/2017, 12:15:52: Rich: Starve until we can find a pub lunch
30/06/2017, 12:15:53: sil: Always pub
30/06/2017, 12:16:07: James: Pint of best and two neurofen it is then.
30/06/2017, 12:16:10: Rich: One day all that was open was a tiny garage tuck shop so we had to make do with mars bars
30/06/2017, 12:16:30: James: Could be worse
30/06/2017, 12:17:24: James: Plenty of energy in a mars bar 🚀
30/06/2017, 12:18:00: Rich: Tru dat
30/06/2017, 12:21:42: sil: Please rememebr the exercise is not the important part of the trip. If you need to train I might start bi weekly sessions at the pub
30/06/2017, 12:21:55: sil: We will start with larger and work our way up
30/06/2017, 12:22:17: Rich: I'll drink you under the table and then cycle you off the road
30/06/2017, 12:29:17: sil: Let's not get competitive drinking
30/06/2017, 12:35:36: sil: Me and Alex are gonna train this weekend
30/06/2017, 12:35:56: Rich: Good
30/06/2017, 12:36:14: Rich: I want you up to 10pints a day by the trip
30/06/2017, 12:36:29: Rich: Really bulk out those livers
30/06/2017, 12:36:56: Rich: On a more serious note, we should aim to do something in the way of training
30/06/2017, 12:39:31: sil: Nah
30/06/2017, 12:39:39: sil: We always do fine
30/06/2017, 12:40:23: sil: Unless anyone has suffered a dip in there health recently
30/06/2017, 12:40:27: Rich: I think we'll be pushing ourselves wth this one
30/06/2017, 12:43:13: sil: It's not about the goal, it's the journey. Take it at a good pace and enjoy it
30/06/2017, 12:45:43: sil: As long as we start early and cycle till Sun set I think we will be ok. And if we don't make it it doesn't matter
30/06/2017, 12:46:24: Rich: We can have a big afternoon out in Ipswich
30/06/2017, 12:46:29: sil: Rememebr its gonna be super flat aswell
30/06/2017, 12:46:46: Rich: I'm not so sure looking at the route
30/06/2017, 12:47:19: sil: Really?
I feel like that area would be super flat like Norfolk
30/06/2017, 13:03:29: Rich: I'll double check. I haven't really
Compared it to other rides
30/06/2017, 13:11:14: sil: Specially as we're closer to the sea
30/06/2017, 13:27:05: James: <‎image omitted>
30/06/2017, 13:28:25: James: It's very hilly near the cost but we were coming from southwold going inland so should be easier the other way.
30/06/2017, 13:28:37: James: *coast
30/06/2017, 13:36:21: Rich: It looks like we climb more than on any previous bike trip
30/06/2017, 13:37:02: sil: Interesting. That goes against all my assumptions
30/06/2017, 13:37:17: Rich: Yeah
30/06/2017, 13:37:24: Rich: There's quite a long climb leaving London
30/06/2017, 13:37:52: Rich: 1/6th of the climbing
30/06/2017, 13:38:05: sil: Guess that the benefit of the wash trip, it's pretty flat up to and past Cambridge. But southwald looks better
30/06/2017, 13:38:08: Rich: I think it's quite steady though
30/06/2017, 13:38:15: Rich: Yeah
30/06/2017, 13:38:54: Rich: I think it's crossing valleys near the coast
30/06/2017, 13:39:13: Rich: Dedham vale has a 100ft climb
30/06/2017, 23:00:25: James: Why am I at Oxford Circus.  This is literally hell on earth.
30/06/2017, 23:00:34: James: 😫
01/07/2017, 18:22:15: Alex Brown: Oxford circus
01/07/2017, 18:22:23: Alex Brown: What were you doing
01/07/2017, 19:08:37: James: Haha wrong convo
01/07/2017, 19:09:42: James: To answer the question, I was out in West End for lunch, which got somewhat out of hand drinkwise..
01/07/2017, 19:12:36: Rich: I bet you didn't get many quantities surveyed that afternoon
01/07/2017, 19:12:45: Rich: Am I right?
01/07/2017, 19:12:47: Rich: Lad
01/07/2017, 19:29:24: Alex Brown: Lad lad lad
01/07/2017, 19:31:52: James: Lol
01/07/2017, 19:32:19: James: I surveyed many bars...
01/07/2017, 19:33:07: James: All facilities were in good condition and all beer taps were fully functional.
01/07/2017, 19:33:32: Rich: How many bricks were there though?
01/07/2017, 19:34:55: Alex Brown: H16 BARS
01/07/2017, 19:35:04: Alex Brown: Structural engineer joke
01/07/2017, 19:35:10: Alex Brown: NUT
01/07/2017, 19:35:32: James: 😑
01/07/2017, 19:35:51: Alex Brown: Engineering banter
01/07/2017, 19:36:46: James: Dunno. You'd have to ask a QS
01/07/2017, 19:49:53: James: <‎image omitted>
01/07/2017, 19:50:24: Rich: Pfft all surveyors are the same
01/07/2017, 19:59:11: Alex Brown: That's right

01/07/2017, 20:09:49: James: 😂
01/07/2017, 20:10:12: Rich: It isn't
01/07/2017, 21:18:55: Alex Brown: Ha everything is wrong
01/07/2017, 21:19:08: Alex Brown: Apart from the last one

09/07/2017, 14:20:07: Alex Brown: I mean
09/07/2017, 14:20:13: Alex Brown: I'm not being a cock
09/07/2017, 14:20:26: Alex Brown: But it's just not useful all round
09/07/2017, 14:20:37: Alex Brown: And you move jobs now
09/07/2017, 14:20:39: sil: from the man who cycles once a year

09/07/2017, 14:25:11: sil: can store it in your flat easy
09/07/2017, 14:25:27: Rich: how much is your dad trying to sell his bike for?

09/07/2017, 14:25:55: Alex Brown: It's fat
09/07/2017, 14:25:55: Alex Brown: If you had a bike we could go for mini bike rides
09/07/2017, 14:26:03: sil: I don't have any space to keep it.
09/07/2017, 14:26:08: Alex Brown: Ha
09/07/2017, 14:26:14: Alex Brown: He was a few months ago
09/07/2017, 14:26:24: sil: he said he was thinking about it
09/07/2017, 14:26:54: Alex Brown: Has he fixed the cables yet
09/07/2017, 14:27:09: Alex Brown: Or is that something you're gonna have to do
09/07/2017, 14:27:12: sil: I don't think so. that's what I'm doing when i go up
09/07/2017, 14:27:25: Alex Brown: The cables are ragged
09/07/2017, 14:27:26: Alex Brown: Ok
09/07/2017, 14:27:32: Alex Brown: Cheap to fix
09/07/2017, 14:27:41: Alex Brown: Like 7 quid
09/07/2017, 14:28:01: Alex Brown: I'm taking mine for a service
09/07/2017, 14:28:13: sil: yeah, will have to pay for the cable and to get the gears tuned
09/07/2017, 14:28:15: Alex Brown: And gonna get a new sprocket
09/07/2017, 14:28:25: Alex Brown: Gear ring is bent up
09/07/2017, 14:28:41: Alex Brown: OEM is cheap shit
09/07/2017, 14:28:51: Alex Brown: So my gears are really crap
09/07/2017, 14:29:18: Alex Brown: Need 3 brand new front rings and a tune up
09/07/2017, 14:29:33: Alex Brown: Then it'll be badman
09/07/2017, 14:30:05: sil: yes, treat your bike for it's yearly outing
09/07/2017, 14:30:16: Alex Brown: Allow it
09/07/2017, 14:31:56: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/07/2017, 14:32:04: Alex Brown: I'm gonna turn up in that

09/07/2017, 14:36:44: Alex Brown: Balls
09/07/2017, 14:52:55: James: That's not gun jack
09/07/2017, 14:53:15: James: That's scrotum jack
09/07/2017, 14:53:27: James: Different character
09/07/2017, 15:34:40: James: I'm going to resurrect by Kona Cindercone for the trip - hard tail with front susp. Think I might try and get a pair of slicks for it seeing as we're roading
09/07/2017, 15:35:21: James: Need to get it serviced as haven't ridden it for about  3 years. Should be fine.
09/07/2017, 15:40:11: Rich: yes Kona! Mine is a Kona
09/07/2017, 15:40:22: Rich: I'd recommend not using slicks as we will definitely be doing some offroading
09/07/2017, 15:40:33: Rich: nothing major but enough for slicks to be inappropriate
09/07/2017, 15:41:28: James: So sluggish.....so many road miles....
09/07/2017, 15:42:06: Rich: there's like 10 miles of Epping Forest and we'll definitely be going off road looking for camping spots
09/07/2017, 15:41:49: James: Better to have it and not need it.....
09/07/2017, 15:42:45: Rich: compromise with small off road tyres?
09/07/2017, 15:42:35: Alex Brown: Noon slicks james
09/07/2017, 15:42:36: Alex Brown: Were gonna off road too
09/07/2017, 15:42:37: Alex Brown: Get semi slick at a min
09/07/2017, 15:43:06: Rich: I went up the route we're taking through Epping today and I imagine it would be a pain in the arse with slicks
09/07/2017, 15:43:55: James: Cool cool.
09/07/2017, 15:44:49: James: I meant yes to non-slicks here if that wasn't clear
09/07/2017, 15:45:38: Alex Brown: Trust James don't do slicks
09/07/2017, 15:45:42: Alex Brown: You'll regret it
09/07/2017, 15:45:42: Alex Brown: And that would be unfair on sil and rich who will be way behind
09/07/2017, 15:45:43: Alex Brown: They aren't extremely fit like me
09/07/2017, 15:46:03: Alex Brown: Ah

09/07/2017, 15:49:40: Alex Brown: I don't wanna wear out my cycle muscles
09/07/2017, 15:49:46: Alex Brown: Before the big day
09/07/2017, 15:50:48: Rich: we should do a training ride some evening this week
09/07/2017, 15:51:02: Rich: maybe something manageable like 15 miles and three pubs?
09/07/2017, 16:02:12: Rich: Here's a nice training route from near yours:

09/07/2017, 16:05:21: Alex Brown: Jovial
09/07/2017, 16:05:31: Alex Brown: We should beer

09/07/2017, 16:06:22: Alex Brown: I'm on the fitness drinks till the bike trip
09/07/2017, 16:06:34: Alex Brown: Steaks lean and tonic lean
09/07/2017, 16:06:41: Alex Brown: What u up to james
09/07/2017, 16:06:52: Alex Brown: We are en route to the flat

09/07/2017, 16:34:45: James: I think it's less about the bike and more about the rider...
09/07/2017, 16:35:17: Rich: Alex on a Boardman is a truly terrifying prospect
09/07/2017, 17:08:35: Rich: There's an arcade with loads of whacky machines in Southwold:

http://www.underthepier.com/10_current_machines.htm
09/07/2017, 17:09:19: James: It's proper proper weird lol
09/07/2017, 17:09:26: James: Disturbing even...
09/07/2017, 17:33:17: Rich: have you been?
09/07/2017, 17:34:18: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/07/2017, 17:34:20: Alex Brown: Ew
09/07/2017, 17:34:27: Alex Brown: Mega disturbing
09/07/2017, 17:40:55: James: Yup. Me and my mate Oli did 50miles over two days around southwold so I know a few places worth stopping by.
09/07/2017, 17:41:28: James: The pier is weird but definitely worth a look
09/07/2017, 17:42:20: James: There's some nice sea food shacks a little further down the coast (15mins) - ultra fresh
09/07/2017, 17:43:29: Rich: oh cool that will be good for soaking up the booze
09/07/2017, 17:43:59: Alex Brown: Gonna get wrecked
09/07/2017, 17:44:10: Alex Brown: Is it easy to train home
09/07/2017, 17:44:24: Rich: we have to get a bus first which is a pain
09/07/2017, 17:45:50: Rich: unless we cycle to the train
09/07/2017, 17:45:56: James: With four bikes lol
09/07/2017, 17:46:00: Rich: after that it's a couple of hours by train
09/07/2017, 17:46:04: Rich: yeah it'll be ridiculous
09/07/2017, 17:46:58: Rich: we could cycle rather than getting the bus. 10 miles and basically flat. But we'll probably be knackered
09/07/2017, 17:47:54: James: 🍺🚴🏻🍺🚴🏻🍺🚴🏻🍺🚴🏻

09/07/2017, 19:09:42: Alex Brown: Cute
09/07/2017, 19:10:06: Alex Brown: That's it I'm feeding the steak to myshka
09/07/2017, 19:11:06: James: Lol
09/07/2017, 19:11:16: James: She is wasting away...
09/07/2017, 19:11:35: Alex Brown: It's good steak bro
09/07/2017, 19:11:37: James: When did I not like steak?
09/07/2017, 19:11:48: Alex Brown: It was sarcastic
09/07/2017, 19:12:10: Alex Brown: I rubbed smoked garlic paste into i
09/07/2017, 19:12:18: Alex Brown: And sprinkled rosemary
09/07/2017, 19:12:23: Alex Brown: V nice
09/07/2017, 19:12:31: James: With a dash of knob butter?
09/07/2017, 19:12:39: Alex Brown: No knobs
09/07/2017, 19:12:45: James: Shame
09/07/2017, 19:12:59: Alex Brown: No knob shaped blobs of butter
09/07/2017, 19:13:08: Alex Brown: I'm on a cycling fit diet bro
09/07/2017, 19:13:23: James: Hence eating steak
09/07/2017, 19:13:40: Alex Brown: 🚫
09/07/2017, 19:13:43: Alex Brown: Butter
09/07/2017, 19:13:57: James: Eating clean...
09/07/2017, 19:14:22: James: You want to be careful with that
09/07/2017, 19:14:39: James: I hear it has potential side effects
09/07/2017, 19:14:51: Alex Brown: What beating your slow ads
09/07/2017, 19:14:54: Alex Brown: Asss

09/07/2017, 19:31:44: Rich: I got the mini one as it's a bit lighter but it can be awkward to lock onto things some times
09/07/2017, 19:33:09: Alex Brown: Yeh might get the big style

10/07/2017, 11:21:11: Alex Brown: Lol word play banter
10/07/2017, 11:22:03: sil: it is true, those camping mats are super quick to inflate
10/07/2017, 11:22:13: sil: because there is literally fuck all air in them
10/07/2017, 11:22:45: sil: I have one for first Glastonbury and it was wank. such a shallow cushion of air
10/07/2017, 11:22:51: sil: had
10/07/2017, 11:22:52: Rich: Yeah I'm shopping around because I don't want to be uncomfortable
10/07/2017, 11:22:59: Rich: Some have fairly good reviews
10/07/2017, 11:23:34: sil: the best purchase you could make is a battery pump and adaptors
10/07/2017, 11:23:45: sil: and then lilo inflates no time
10/07/2017, 11:25:57: sil: lilo is a pain to blow up, but that's cause they take alot of air. which means alot of cushioning. don't think you'll find that much cushioning for that little weight and price. but 1 battery powered pump will change the game
10/07/2017, 11:26:37: Rich: Those lilos are a bit crap anyway though. They're a pain to blow up and put away because they have tiny bungs. And they're fairly heavy for what they are
10/07/2017, 11:26:50: Rich: A good camping mat would be better
10/07/2017, 11:27:48: sil: a good battery pump will have an reverse pump
10/07/2017, 11:33:57: sil: Yellowstone Battery Powered Pump https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0037CF6G6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_KF1yzb5Z5P5YD

10/07/2017, 11:35:13: sil: don't think he has an air bed pump
10/07/2017, 11:35:20: sil: could ask though would save money
10/07/2017, 11:35:45: James: Borrowings the way to go fo sho
10/07/2017, 11:47:23: sil: unsure if this is pure bants or not.....
10/07/2017, 11:53:21: James: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 12:45:55: sil: I see. thank you for outlining the bants
10/07/2017, 12:46:27: sil: important to have a regular debrief on the bantline
10/07/2017, 12:47:07: Rich: I'd like to bring forward this afternoon's banting
10/07/2017, 12:47:18: Rich: I have some important bant charts to discuss
10/07/2017, 12:47:47: sil: Rich, please go on. enlighten us.
10/07/2017, 12:52:14: James: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 12:53:42: sil: Alex regularly bathes in LMAOnnaise
10/07/2017, 12:54:02: James: The chart is certainly apt!
10/07/2017, 12:55:22: sil: quite rude of you though james.
I believe you've interrupted richs important agenda
10/07/2017, 12:55:57: sil: Rich, please take the stage.
what were your topics for consideration?
10/07/2017, 12:56:07: Rich: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 12:56:31: Rich: As you know in the first banter of the year we made excess bants of top lad
10/07/2017, 12:57:15: Rich: Now we're in the "Need" stage, as in Alex needs to up his game as we've seen only weak bants from him
10/07/2017, 12:58:20: Rich: I'd also like to bring your attention to the time frame, as it's important that during this crucial quarter we increase the bant rate until we reach "top bants"
10/07/2017, 12:59:05: sil: very compelling Rich.
your are right regarding Alex's status as a total weak lad.
10/07/2017, 12:59:47: Rich: He really need to bant up his ideas if he wants to roll with the banter bus
10/07/2017, 12:59:51: Rich: 🚌
10/07/2017, 13:00:37: sil: yes, he's currently riding back of the banta bus
10/07/2017, 13:00:57: sil: which is bad new for Nicola, cus he's likely to find a new girlfriend there
10/07/2017, 13:01:10: sil: NUT
10/07/2017, 13:01:58: Rich: Girlfriends have no place on the banta bus
10/07/2017, 13:02:30: sil: #NotRacistItsJustBanta
10/07/2017, 13:04:21: James: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 13:04:41: James: Next stop Banterbury
10/07/2017, 13:42:40: Alex Brown: Very rude sil
10/07/2017, 13:42:44: Alex Brown: Very
10/07/2017, 13:42:48: Alex Brown: Rude
10/07/2017, 13:43:19: Alex Brown: Bants there whereever he may be
10/07/2017, 13:43:41: Alex Brown: I am the Lord of the bants said he
10/07/2017, 13:57:01: sil: sorry alex. I apologise about joking about your old fetish. it was just a phase
10/07/2017, 13:58:10: sil: if you can't stand the bants, get off the banter bus

10/07/2017, 15:41:30: sil: hell child
10/07/2017, 15:41:32: James: 😶
10/07/2017, 15:53:09: Rich: Cat exists
10/07/2017, 15:53:19: Rich: Alex acknowledges existence of cat
10/07/2017, 16:08:05: sil: actually decided that I'm way above all of this "banter" now.
its very childish. I'm a man to be web.
10/07/2017, 16:08:09: sil: it's very much below me
10/07/2017, 16:08:52: sil: i won't be boarding the "banter bus" any more
10/07/2017, 16:09:37: sil: wed*
not web
10/07/2017, 16:14:11: Rich: Bound up in that tight spider silk never to escape
10/07/2017, 16:15:15: sil: I'm sorry rich. was that meant to be some banter?
I cant hear it from all the way down there
10/07/2017, 16:15:33: sil: (I'm implying it's very far below me)
10/07/2017, 16:16:14: Rich: I'd suggest coming down here but I guess you can't unglue yourself from that web
10/07/2017, 16:17:09: sil: if I unglued myself from the web these internet texts wouldn't get very far would they 😏
10/07/2017, 16:18:41: sil: 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
10/07/2017, 16:18:59: Rich: Hawhawhaw
10/07/2017, 16:20:14: sil: see. you don't have to be mean to make a good joke.
being mean is very below me. wouldn't stoop to your level
10/07/2017, 16:22:20: Rich: ...
10/07/2017, 16:22:23: Alex Brown: Rich is so low he's pulling out bottom feeder bants
10/07/2017, 16:22:52: Alex Brown: Sil is so wet he may as well be at the bottom of the ocean with rich
10/07/2017, 16:23:44: sil: actually quite alot of interesting stuff at the bottom of the ocean 🙂
10/07/2017, 16:24:10: Alex Brown: Yeh rich's mom
10/07/2017, 16:24:41: Rich: Alex would you cut that out? It's not very nice.
10/07/2017, 16:25:08: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 16:25:11: Alex Brown: Banter
10/07/2017, 16:26:30: James: <‎image omitted>
10/07/2017, 16:26:52: sil: hmm, nice to see you taking a moral stance rich
10/07/2017, 16:27:17: sil: it's actually kind of sad seeing Alex post this sort of thing
10/07/2017, 16:27:24: sil: I'm actually embarrassed for him
10/07/2017, 16:28:55: Rich: I won't hear such harsh words. Alex needs our kind support to help him grow up a bit
10/07/2017, 16:29:27: Alex Brown: I drive the bus m8
10/07/2017, 16:30:30: sil: hmm, actually rich. I sense your taking the piss. maybe your a little child who likes to belittle people too. pathetic actually when you think about it
10/07/2017, 16:31:36: Rich: My "a little child" wouldn't belittle anyone!
10/07/2017, 16:32:57: sil: pathetic. your being cery patronising. grow up. or do you not know how?
10/07/2017, 16:33:07: sil: "banter" is toxic
10/07/2017, 16:34:17: sil: think it's sad how you all gang up on alex. he's obviously the fastest and fittest. it's stupid how you ignore him he says so.
10/07/2017, 16:34:58: Rich: Oh, it's hard to admit but alex is just so fit that it makes me feel small. I bully him because I'm anxious about how much fitter than me he really is
10/07/2017, 16:35:21: sil: very brave of you rich
10/07/2017, 16:35:25: sil: admirable
10/07/2017, 16:43:05: sil: don't worry guys. daddy confirmed that he already fixed the gear cables
10/07/2017, 16:43:40: sil: looks like I'll have the best most expensive bike after all. yay 😄
10/07/2017, 16:57:26: Rich: How lovely for you. And without pannier racks so you won't have to carry any of that nasty weight! :)
10/07/2017, 16:57:48: Rich: Make sure you bring a small rucksack so you can't fit any fluids. Fluids are heavy
10/07/2017, 16:58:33: sil: oh I didn't think about that!
yay ☺
10/07/2017, 16:58:52: sil: guess you will have room for the tent in your pannier
10/07/2017, 17:01:48: sil: in all seriousness. I'm thinking of getting this....
10/07/2017, 17:01:51: sil: Intsun Waterproof 3L Bike Handlebar Bag Cycling Bicycle Mountain Road MTB Bike Handlebar Bag Front Top Frame Pouch PVC Tube bag Roll Top Closure Front Pannier Basket Bag https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XGYJCMF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_qt6yzb2C3ZF8S
10/07/2017, 17:01:57: sil: but dunno if it's worth it
10/07/2017, 17:02:43: sil: guess 3 litres isn't loads
10/07/2017, 17:03:41: Rich: It's more of a useful items bag than a lots of stuff bag
10/07/2017, 17:03:54: Rich: Could you fit a pannier to your dads bike?
10/07/2017, 17:04:09: sil: nope, doesnt have the bolts
10/07/2017, 17:04:14: sil: checked before
10/07/2017, 17:04:29: Rich: I guess it weakens a perfectly fine mountain bike
10/07/2017, 17:04:51: sil: yeah it's not made for that sort of thing
10/07/2017, 17:05:03: sil: just want something Velcro that has good volume
10/07/2017, 17:05:18: sil: just to get stuff off my back
10/07/2017, 17:13:16: sil: might just buy some Velcro straps. try to strap my tent onto the handle bars like that bag
10/07/2017, 17:30:16: Rich: Didn't tie it to the middle bar of your bike last time?
10/07/2017, 17:38:35: sil: i used some bunjee ropes on my sleeping bag
10/07/2017, 17:38:41: sil: knocked around a bit tho
10/07/2017, 17:39:13: sil: rich if we do get a battery pump. why not just take it double mattress. now it's 2 per tent
10/07/2017, 17:39:28: sil: or is it still super bulky deflated?
10/07/2017, 17:54:21: sil: I can't picture how small it folds down to
10/07/2017, 18:11:52: Rich: It's pretty big tbh
10/07/2017, 18:12:00: Rich: Also I think it started leaking at Skell's
10/07/2017, 18:26:39: Alex Brown: We need a tent james so I guaranteed a place to witness your bottom feeder breakfast banter
10/07/2017, 19:03:16: sil: a tent is very essential
10/07/2017, 19:03:18: James: Lol
10/07/2017, 19:03:30: sil: one of the most essential parts minus the bike
10/07/2017, 19:03:40: James: Can you rephrase that gibberish into plain English please?
10/07/2017, 19:04:01: James: 😁
10/07/2017, 19:04:29: Alex Brown: We need a tent
10/07/2017, 19:04:48: Alex Brown: Otherwise it's 4 men cosy in a 3 man tent
10/07/2017, 19:04:59: Alex Brown: And someone's getting bummed
10/07/2017, 19:05:07: Alex Brown: And it's deffo not me
10/07/2017, 19:05:25: Alex Brown: I'm the hair troking ass rapist
10/07/2017, 19:05:52: Alex Brown: Although it could be 3 men in a tent and one ass rapist lurking outside
10/07/2017, 19:07:37: Alex Brown: Let's look tonight bro
10/07/2017, 19:07:47: Alex Brown: When you home?

10/07/2017, 19:10:53: James: Cool cool
10/07/2017, 19:11:06: James: Bout an hour I guess
10/07/2017, 19:26:14: Rich: I've got a tent you can use
10/07/2017, 19:26:36: Alex Brown: Is it mega light weight
10/07/2017, 19:26:54: Alex Brown: Your grey tent is massive bro
10/07/2017, 19:28:04: Rich: It's a 3 man. Bigger than Sils but not massive
10/07/2017, 19:28:41: sil: pretty bulky
10/07/2017, 19:28:47: Alex Brown: Yeh
10/07/2017, 19:28:55: Alex Brown: It is pretty bulky
10/07/2017, 19:28:57: sil: but as long as it's nothing to do with me I don't care
10/07/2017, 19:29:01: Alex Brown: It's an ootion
10/07/2017, 19:29:12: Alex Brown: Very thoughtful

10/07/2017, 19:32:15: sil: that's ok. we don't want to use your inflatable camping bathroom

10/07/2017, 21:30:38: Alex Brown: Porch is useless ground is wet
10/07/2017, 21:31:04: sil: it's good for sticking muddy bags and boots
10/07/2017, 21:31:19: sil: otherwise you have to put them in your tent
10/07/2017, 21:31:31: Alex Brown: Ahh well be ight

10/07/2017, 21:36:54: Alex Brown: Nice for airflow
10/07/2017, 21:37:18: sil: it's a whole kilogram lighter than my tent
10/07/2017, 21:37:29: sil: the grey one. not your cheap one

10/07/2017, 21:50:42: Alex Brown: I would like a nice one but it's expensive
10/07/2017, 21:50:58: Alex Brown: Think we should go for the 100 quid one
10/07/2017, 22:11:22: Alex Brown: Thinking of getting one of these with a water pack
10/07/2017, 22:11:27: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>

10/07/2017, 22:18:23: sil: itinerary is a plan of action

10/07/2017, 22:21:16: sil: why don't you and James go for suuuper light 2 man
10/07/2017, 22:21:47: sil: almost 2 kg lighter than my tent
10/07/2017, 22:37:12: Alex Brown: Think we're going with the first one
10/07/2017, 22:37:30: Alex Brown: It's roomy and has a double door for ventilation
10/07/2017, 22:37:38: sil: and it's the cheapest
10/07/2017, 22:37:47: Alex Brown: Whilst packing as small s yours
10/07/2017, 22:38:10: Alex Brown: I like the 3 man ultra the most
10/07/2017, 22:38:19: Alex Brown: But it's too expensive
10/07/2017, 22:38:48: sil: get blow up tent
10/07/2017, 22:38:58: Alex Brown: Nah they're heavy
10/07/2017, 22:39:04: Alex Brown: Suoprisingly
10/07/2017, 22:39:07: Alex Brown: And huge
10/07/2017, 22:39:17: Alex Brown: When they pack down
10/07/2017, 22:39:38: sil: yeah, they are like 5 people tents
10/07/2017, 22:39:58: Alex Brown: Just a gimik
10/07/2017, 22:47:06: Alex Brown: Yeh this one were getting you can open 3 sides
10/07/2017, 22:47:25: Alex Brown: There's front and back doors and a mini side hatch
10/07/2017, 22:47:31: sil: sounds poorly insulated
10/07/2017, 22:47:41: Alex Brown: And it's same set up as yours
10/07/2017, 22:47:55: Alex Brown: You can close it all up
10/07/2017, 22:48:16: Alex Brown: It's got the outer cover like yours
10/07/2017, 22:48:38: Alex Brown: But you can roll it up and there's loads of zips
10/07/2017, 22:48:50: Alex Brown: Will be nice in the morning
10/07/2017, 22:48:52: sil: loads of zips
10/07/2017, 22:48:59: Alex Brown: Yours gets super hot
10/07/2017, 22:49:17: sil: why are you justifying buying the very cheapest tent?
10/07/2017, 22:49:32: sil: bants
10/07/2017, 22:49:34: Alex Brown: It's alright
10/07/2017, 22:50:00: Alex Brown: The 3 man ultra has a bad man porch tho
10/07/2017, 22:50:51: sil: I'm sure the 100 one is fine to be fair
10/07/2017, 22:51:45: Alex Brown: Yeh it's 0.1kg lighter than yours blud
10/07/2017, 22:51:55: Alex Brown: And same size
10/07/2017, 22:52:03: Alex Brown: Basically same tent
10/07/2017, 22:52:12: Alex Brown: With lame colours
10/07/2017, 22:57:47: James: Camouflage

10/07/2017, 22:58:12: sil: cheap and light.
but looks a bit wank
10/07/2017, 22:59:39: James: Sunny delight in tent form
11/07/2017, 08:25:51: Alex Brown: The farmer would know exactly where to point his shotgun
11/07/2017, 08:26:33: sil: haha, yeah its not great for illegally camping
11/07/2017, 08:26:35: Rich: Seems like a bargain
11/07/2017, 08:26:41: Rich: I bet it's pretty small
11/07/2017, 08:26:48: sil: all the cheaper tents seem to be in garish colours
11/07/2017, 08:29:04: sil: there is a sale on tents at blacks
11/07/2017, 08:29:07: sil: https://m.blacks.co.uk/equipment/tents-camping/tents/?from=24
11/07/2017, 08:29:29: sil: everything reduced. maybe look through that. find a 3 man around 3kg
11/07/2017, 08:30:01: James: Thoroughly sifted, millets have the same sale and the same tents - nothing good unfortunately
11/07/2017, 08:31:07: James: The one Alex found is actually really good value, it's exceptionally light and small packed away for the price
11/07/2017, 08:31:26: sil: https://m.blacks.co.uk/product/red-berghaus-peak-32-2-man-tent/164994/
11/07/2017, 08:31:46: sil: this one lighter. same price
11/07/2017, 08:32:30: sil: reduced from 340
11/07/2017, 08:32:38: Alex Brown: Shit shape bright coloured and 2 man
11/07/2017, 08:33:03: Rich: Looks like a good tent but 2 man would be very cosy
11/07/2017, 08:33:05: Alex Brown: Ours is 3 man
11/07/2017, 08:34:03: James: No cross ventilation = major uncomfort
11/07/2017, 08:34:48: Alex Brown: I'm with James on that point
11/07/2017, 08:36:54: James: Plus you really need to go  one man size up in tent size - otherwise you're sleeping in a body bag with your junk on top of you
11/07/2017, 08:38:52: sil: very wise. you need room for a good barrier between  you and Alex
11/07/2017, 08:39:11: sil: your junk usually goes in the porch tho
11/07/2017, 08:39:41: James: The kit will form a central partition - no gaps or glory holes
11/07/2017, 08:40:51: sil: I recommend a wall of rape alarms
11/07/2017, 08:41:31: Rich: I recommend a therapist
11/07/2017, 08:42:28: sil: I prefer an analrapist
11/07/2017, 08:42:56: Rich: I've actually been rewatching some of arrested development
11/07/2017, 08:43:17: Rich: They've just introduced bob lob law
11/07/2017, 08:43:56: sil: ha, nice. still really good those first seasons. it's a shame they didn't do the latest season properly
11/07/2017, 08:44:19: sil: bob lob law law blog
11/07/2017, 08:45:44: Rich: I think they focussed too much on the gimmick in the latest season
11/07/2017, 08:45:51: Rich: But yeah it's great
11/07/2017, 08:46:25: Rich: There's a lot of subtle jokes that could easily be missed the first time
11/07/2017, 08:46:31: Rich: Like puns and background bits
11/07/2017, 08:46:39: James: Is that the one with the family who all live in a show house?
11/07/2017, 08:47:16: sil: yeah, well apparently the cast were so famous now they couldn't get everyone on the same filming schedule at once, so it was the only way they could do it
11/07/2017, 08:47:24: James: Dad's in prison and they're all majorly dysfunctional
11/07/2017, 08:47:36: sil: that's the one
11/07/2017, 08:48:10: sil: lots of great wordplay and puns
11/07/2017, 08:48:46: James: Something about withholding rings a bell
11/07/2017, 08:49:39: Rich: Ah that makes sense I guess. You think they'd go back and do it for the love of it
11/07/2017, 08:49:54: Rich: I swear Michael Cera isn't doing as much now
11/07/2017, 08:52:00: James: STEVE HOLT!!!
11/07/2017, 08:52:09: sil: yeah i don't see him and maybe in much these days. dangerous cousins spin off?
11/07/2017, 08:53:18: Rich: Ha that would be good
11/07/2017, 08:53:31: Rich: They were going to do more seasons or a movie at one point
11/07/2017, 08:53:39: Rich: I guess season 4 wasn't enough of a success
11/07/2017, 09:03:48: James: What camping specific items do you normally take on trips?
11/07/2017, 09:04:38: James: Do you take a stove or not bother?
11/07/2017, 09:06:07: Rich: No stove
11/07/2017, 09:06:30: Rich: Fire lighters, lamp, water bottle, tent, sleeping bag, lilo
11/07/2017, 09:06:38: Rich: Pretty minimal
11/07/2017, 09:06:48: Rich: Maybe a warm jumper
11/07/2017, 09:06:59: Rich: But generally we keep it as light as possible
11/07/2017, 09:07:17: Rich: We can drink through the discomfort and eat hot meals in pubs
11/07/2017, 09:22:09: James: And what do you normally bring in terms of  entertainment?
11/07/2017, 09:26:38: Rich: Booze, weed and alex
11/07/2017, 09:28:58: James: Ha
11/07/2017, 09:29:12: James: I'll bring a frisbee
11/07/2017, 09:29:53: James: Think Alex is bringing speakers
11/07/2017, 09:30:26: James: Has anyone got an mp3 player we can load with tunes to save on phone battery?
11/07/2017, 10:12:47: sil: battery chargers is a good idea if you have one
11/07/2017, 10:12:48: sil: I would suggest at very minimum: 

-Tent
-lilo
-light weight sleeping bag
-underwear x2
-socks, pair x2
-t-shirt x1
-jumper
-light waterproof
11/07/2017, 10:13:21: sil: everything else we should organise as a group so we don't over take stuff. we don't need tool kits and torches each
11/07/2017, 10:13:22: sil: and aslong as we have atleast l 1 spare inner tube per person, we can always 're stock if we have to use one
11/07/2017, 10:16:19: Rich: I'm taking three spare innertubes
11/07/2017, 10:16:26: Rich: Not taking any chances!
11/07/2017, 10:31:38: James: I'm bringing three rape alarms
11/07/2017, 10:31:49: James: Not taking any chances!
11/07/2017, 10:38:22: Alex Brown: I'm taking 3 gimp masks I'm not taking any chances!
11/07/2017, 10:49:42: Rich: I'd hate to be the person that doesn't get to have a gimp mask
11/07/2017, 11:01:04: Alex Brown: You can bite on the ball
11/07/2017, 11:01:17: Alex Brown: That will help pass the bum time
11/07/2017, 11:07:11: James: Lol!
11/07/2017, 11:07:28: James: Bum bants
11/07/2017, 11:10:22: sil: nice, 1 more inner tube and that's 1 per person
11/07/2017, 11:14:29: Rich: You need innertubes suitable for your bike
11/07/2017, 11:14:42: Rich: If they're the wrong size/valve they won't work properly
11/07/2017, 11:14:45: Rich: Bring innertubes
11/07/2017, 11:17:53: sil: aslong as no has racing or tires it aight
11/07/2017, 11:18:09: sil: racing or road tires*
11/07/2017, 11:22:28: James: Who's got a pump?
11/07/2017, 11:23:09: James: Alex has presta only I think
11/07/2017, 11:23:30: sil: if someone's got a decent duel nozzle then thats good
11/07/2017, 11:23:46: James: I have a duo track pump but it's an upright type
11/07/2017, 11:24:04: sil: yeah that sounds too heavy
11/07/2017, 11:24:44: sil: I'm gonna buy a whole load of bunjee ropes today. for tightening things to bikes.
11/07/2017, 11:27:48: James: Where from?
11/07/2017, 11:29:13: sil: amazon
11/07/2017, 11:29:40: sil: <‎image omitted>
11/07/2017, 11:29:47: sil: and a cargo net
11/07/2017, 11:32:58: James: Nice
11/07/2017, 11:33:39: sil: gonna use some for some of my stuff, but I'll take the spares for fastening shopping or whatever
11/07/2017, 11:33:56: sil: for
11/07/2017, 11:35:18: James: We'll have to have a think about all kit vs all available storage to sort out even loads. I'm thinking of bringing a medium back pack with two side pannier bags, then they'll be some room on top of the pannier to strap something.
11/07/2017, 11:35:42: James: Probably tent
11/07/2017, 11:38:22: James: What's the net for?
11/07/2017, 11:42:53: Rich: I have a light dual pump I'm bringing
11/07/2017, 11:43:41: sil: the tent of for catching dinner James
11/07/2017, 11:43:51: sil: in the evening we have to hunt
11/07/2017, 11:45:03: Rich: You should have seen the sheep we caught last time
11/07/2017, 11:45:07: Rich: It was delicious
11/07/2017, 11:44:55: sil: sometimes we snag ourselves a child. but it's hard to keep Alex under control so the whole thing gets messy. so maybe stick to small rodents and birds this time
11/07/2017, 11:47:53: James: I'll bring some mint sauce  then just in case
11/07/2017, 12:47:13: Alex Brown: Rich climbed out of the back of I before we cooked it
11/07/2017, 12:49:19: James: Special sauce...
11/07/2017, 12:49:41: Alex Brown: Lmaonaise
11/07/2017, 12:50:12: Alex Brown: Sil get a bag like this that requires no pannier
11/07/2017, 12:50:28: Alex Brown: Obviously not this expensive though
11/07/2017, 12:50:42: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
11/07/2017, 12:51:04: Alex Brown: Those are cool
11/07/2017, 13:29:31: sil: they're pretty small
11/07/2017, 13:29:49: sil: and that's a over expensive one
11/07/2017, 13:31:48: sil: gonna be able to achieve the same thing with bunjee ropes
11/07/2017, 13:33:14: Alex Brown: Maybe so
11/07/2017, 13:33:40: Alex Brown: Just get a football boot bag and strap that
11/07/2017, 13:34:14: Alex Brown: That'll be tough and water proof
11/07/2017, 13:34:35: James: Need to be mindful whatever you strap can't spin round and fall into your spokes
11/07/2017, 13:35:00: Alex Brown: And with the net you can hook it to the saddle somehow
11/07/2017, 13:35:23: Alex Brown: Yeh needs to be secure that shit always takes a beating
11/07/2017, 13:36:17: James: Also needs to be easy to remove for when we stop
11/07/2017, 13:38:00: sil: actually good deal on this one

11/07/2017, 13:38:36: James: Will get you out of all sorts of bother
11/07/2017, 13:38:57: James: And maybe even into some if Alex has his way......

11/07/2017, 13:46:19: Alex Brown: Yeh that's the shit nice a cheap
11/07/2017, 13:46:43: Alex Brown: I might get one of those and scrap the bag on my back
11/07/2017, 13:47:09: sil: the handle bar or seat one?
11/07/2017, 13:50:04: Alex Brown: Handle bar one
11/07/2017, 13:51:23: Alex Brown: Will hold clothes nicely
11/07/2017, 13:53:27: sil: nice, I just got both for 45 quid. steal
11/07/2017, 13:56:35: sil: <‎image omitted>
11/07/2017, 13:56:46: sil: hopefully comes sooner than later
11/07/2017, 13:59:04: sil: but i guess if it doesn't come on time we can just do it on a different weekend. you guys don't mind right?
11/07/2017, 14:31:16: Alex Brown: Yes deffo
11/07/2017, 14:32:02: sil: cool. its agreed then. of my packages don't arrive on time we will do bike ride on a different date in the future
11/07/2017, 14:43:06: James: No problem.
11/07/2017, 15:17:25: Alex Brown: Yeh sil well just delay it for another 6 months because of your poor planning
11/07/2017, 15:18:13: sil: btw we should change the location
11/07/2017, 15:18:27: sil: actually thinking about it maybe southwald isn't the best destination
11/07/2017, 15:18:44: Alex Brown: To your house in heathton maybe
11/07/2017, 15:18:56: sil: no, but we should start there!
11/07/2017, 15:19:00: sil: good idea!
11/07/2017, 15:19:04: Alex Brown: So it's easy to return your bike
11/07/2017, 15:19:17: sil: yeah!!
your on fire Alex
11/07/2017, 15:19:24: Alex Brown: That's a great idea
11/07/2017, 15:19:35: Alex Brown: Let's all do what sil wants to do
11/07/2017, 15:19:54: Alex Brown: Oh high and mighty intellect
11/07/2017, 15:19:54: James: It's settled then. Great 😊
11/07/2017, 15:20:02: sil: ok, let sort this then. so how about we change the date to September and go from my house
11/07/2017, 15:20:10: Alex Brown: Yeh
11/07/2017, 15:20:21: Alex Brown: And then end up at your house
11/07/2017, 15:20:27: sil: a loop!
11/07/2017, 15:20:32: sil: good idea
11/07/2017, 15:20:43: James: <‎image omitted>
11/07/2017, 15:20:52: Alex Brown: Yeh we could ever do some Bathams pubs
11/07/2017, 15:21:18: James: Or maybe just the one opposite Sils?
11/07/2017, 15:21:25: sil: !!!
11/07/2017, 15:21:33: Alex Brown: Even better idea jame
11/07/2017, 15:21:37: James: Very convenient
11/07/2017, 15:21:43: sil: James you boss. i would have never have thought of that great idea
11/07/2017, 15:21:51: Alex Brown: We won't have to even leave sils safe space
11/07/2017, 15:22:06: James: We'll still need full bike repair kits
11/07/2017, 15:22:06: sil: means I won't need to carry a tent as well as I have free accommodation at mine
11/07/2017, 15:22:41: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
11/07/2017, 15:22:42: sil: means a lot less of a load. great brain storming crew!
let's get this in stone
11/07/2017, 15:23:05: sil: so first weekend of September, from my house to the gate and back.
11/07/2017, 15:23:07: sil: perfect
11/07/2017, 15:25:00: sil: I reckon we would save even more weight if we didn't bother with the bikes
11/07/2017, 15:32:07: James: Great. I'll prep and send out copies of the contract. Assume everyone is ok to sign as a deed, and Alex are you ok to sign for Rich?

11/07/2017, 16:15:21: James: Might bring some glowsticks to help thwart any attempted bumming
11/07/2017, 16:15:49: sil: I don't think you want your tent to feel any more like a gay club
11/07/2017, 16:16:33: James: I think we do want our tent to feel like a happy club
11/07/2017, 16:18:49: James: Sarcasm, sniping and intolerance will need to left at the door.
11/07/2017, 16:19:39: James: Or I suppose you could leave it in your tent - where I'm sure it won't be lonely
11/07/2017, 16:20:33: James: 😄

11/07/2017, 17:54:32: James: Test our puncture response time and crisis  commerardary?
11/07/2017, 17:57:02: Alex Brown: Test his ability to take his dad's bike

11/07/2017, 19:54:58: Rich: I think it slowed down once we exhausted all of the equipment for cycling discussion
11/07/2017, 19:54:59: sil: Alex scared of driving Brown
11/07/2017, 19:55:04: Rich: LoL

11/07/2017, 20:39:22: Rich: You didn't need to add extra context for us to recognise David nut James
11/07/2017, 20:40:44: James: Who's David nut?
11/07/2017, 21:19:42: sil: a scientist with very high banter levels

11/07/2017, 21:28:44: Rich: It's off the scale
11/07/2017, 21:28:51: Rich: Off the banter scale!
11/07/2017, 21:30:06: sil: cannabis has a quite high harm to others rating
11/07/2017, 21:30:24: Rich: It's about actual social harm
11/07/2017, 21:30:31: Rich: I think the popularity of cannabis factors into it
11/07/2017, 21:30:33: sil: guess it's all the being lazy and not turning up to shut
11/07/2017, 21:30:36: Rich: Social and health I think
11/07/2017, 21:30:41: Rich: Yeah
11/07/2017, 21:30:40: sil: breaking promises
11/07/2017, 21:34:47: Alex Brown: Maybe it's because it causes    people to smoke even though they said they'd quit
11/07/2017, 21:36:06: Alex Brown: Or maybe that's drinking coffee every morning without fail
11/07/2017, 21:36:22: Alex Brown: That does it
11/07/2017, 21:39:37: sil: shots fired.
Alex just picked up a Ak-banter7 and he's taking no prisoners
11/07/2017, 21:41:29: sil: Rich is bleeding out. the very small amount of dignity he had left draining from his banterless cold body
11/07/2017, 21:42:20: Alex Brown: He's been bantered half to death
11/07/2017, 21:43:31: sil: mate, you made rich look like such a pilock. rich is over. no coming back from that. he doesn't have the chat
11/07/2017, 21:57:33: Rich: Alex sounds grumpy tonight
11/07/2017, 21:57:44: Rich: Is Nicola not letting you have gin either now?
11/07/2017, 21:58:09: sil: haha, Nicola and Alex's mom in cahoots
11/07/2017, 21:59:14: sil: women in your life keeping you down Alex?
shots fired.
rich found a semi-bantermatic in his waist band
11/07/2017, 22:00:06: sil: Alex looks pretty emasculated right about now
11/07/2017, 22:02:00: Alex Brown: I'm above it
11/07/2017, 22:02:08: Alex Brown: Shots can't hit me
11/07/2017, 22:02:35: Rich: They sure can't when you're not allowed to drink

12/07/2017, 11:20:12: sil: James!
that's not very nice!
12/07/2017, 11:21:05: sil: suggesting to poison Alex to put him out of his misery, although very just, is actually very mean!
Alex will say when he wants to end his suffering!
12/07/2017, 11:46:12: Rich: Three cheers for James!!!
12/07/2017, 11:46:15: Rich: Hip hop

12/07/2017, 15:32:08: James: They're clad in Portland Stone so I assume they're encasing steel columns, loadbearing or not. Have you ever known Portland Stone to be used in a loadbearing context?
12/07/2017, 15:33:25: sil: haha, that's what was thinking.
who would have thought Portland stone could be used for load bearing!?
ridiculous
12/07/2017, 16:03:56: James: Yeah, its not as stable as steel and tends to crumble under the slighest pressure, bit like you on a hill climb Sil

17/07/2017, 14:55:24: sil: it was super cheap. reduced from 50 to 20. so probs coming from a Chinese warehouse somewhere. will be good for the next rid any way
17/07/2017, 14:55:58: Rich: Yeah
17/07/2017, 14:56:05: Rich: Are your tyres on the way?
17/07/2017, 14:56:51: sil: indeed. not from Amazon tho
17/07/2017, 14:56:54: sil: wiggle
17/07/2017, 14:57:02: sil: can't risk cheap with tires
17/07/2017, 14:57:29: sil: they have a puncture free guarantee. so if I get a puncture I'm gonna get my money back
17/07/2017, 14:58:05: James: Link?
17/07/2017, 15:01:17: sil: scroll up about 300 messages
17/07/2017, 15:01:20: sil: you'll find it
17/07/2017, 15:03:31: sil: http://www.wiggle.co.uk/continental-country-plus-city-mtb-tyre/
18/07/2017, 10:23:43: sil: hey everyone. I've got an idea. a totally new plan to suggest.
who's up for some post work cycle sessions?
cycle on the canal around Victoria park?
thinking twice a week u till the bike trip?
a couple of miles and a couple of pints?
18/07/2017, 10:24:00: Alex Brown: Oh yeh rad idea bro
18/07/2017, 10:24:06: Alex Brown: High five
18/07/2017, 10:24:19: Alex Brown: Super keen
18/07/2017, 10:24:37: sil: <‎GIF omitted>
18/07/2017, 10:24:49: sil: Grrrrrrreat
18/07/2017, 10:24:54: sil: I knew you would be
18/07/2017, 10:25:25: sil: cool. i get tyres Friday. so up for starting next week
18/07/2017, 10:27:59: Rich: Yes what a wonderful idea
18/07/2017, 10:28:14: Rich: At what time would everybody be able to meet?
18/07/2017, 10:28:33: Rich: I'm in London fields with my bike at work most days so I'm breezy
18/07/2017, 10:29:29: sil: 7:30 ish
18/07/2017, 10:29:53: Rich: Cool
18/07/2017, 10:30:04: Rich: Are you going to go home and pick up your bike?
18/07/2017, 10:31:23: sil: no, I thought I'd turn up and just walk it
18/07/2017, 10:34:21: Rich: the alternative would be to cycle to work
18/07/2017, 10:34:24: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/51.532503,-0.0450635/51.5375969,-0.1518883/51.5765973,-0.1446386/51.5700245,-0.106541/51.5648504,-0.0466951/51.5326273,-0.0437909/@51.5376309,-0.1553528,14129m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m18!4m17!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-0.1465848!2d51.541127!3s0x48761ae1560c6bb7:0x142aeaff895b49cf!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-0.16516!2d51.5597797!3s0x48761a60627787fd:0x93d6daddaa26bce!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e1?hl=en
18/07/2017, 10:34:28: Rich: that would make a nice training route
18/07/2017, 10:34:43: Rich: 80% off road
18/07/2017, 10:35:58: sil: i would cycle to work, but it's over an hour's cycle and we don't have a shower or anything
18/07/2017, 10:37:32: sil: Look aight. 
we should cycle up muswell hill
18/07/2017, 10:38:31: sil: infact. i found an article a while back about the "peaks" of London. which are just the biggest hills
18/07/2017, 10:38:43: Rich: Ah that's a shame
18/07/2017, 10:38:43: sil: we should just do all those.
18/07/2017, 10:38:49: Rich: Ha yeah
18/07/2017, 10:39:09: Rich: If we go a bit further west in Hampstead I think that would be one of the peaks
18/07/2017, 10:39:38: sil: Alexandra palace is on of the biggest
18/07/2017, 10:39:56: Rich: Yeah that's a mean hill
18/07/2017, 10:40:07: Rich: It's also pretty hilly on the way
18/07/2017, 10:40:53: Rich: Regent's Park to the other side of Hampstead is a pretty decent climb
18/07/2017, 10:41:41: sil: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=list+of+the+highest+points+in+london&oq=list+of+the+highest+points+in+london&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.8525j0j4&client=ms-android-samsung&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8
18/07/2017, 10:43:37: Rich: oh yeah we could head up to highgate too
18/07/2017, 10:45:11: sil: we could all the ones north of the river
18/07/2017, 10:45:14: sil: do
18/07/2017, 10:45:45: sil: although some loom kinda far out
18/07/2017, 10:46:54: Rich: Yeah I think harrow is a bit far
18/07/2017, 10:47:16: Rich: If we do that ride I plotted one night it will give us a feel for the distances
18/07/2017, 10:47:32: Rich: Hampstead ally pally and high gate hills are all just off that route
18/07/2017, 10:47:47: Rich: The route involves 600ft of climbing
18/07/2017, 10:47:53: Rich: Although a lot should be fairly flat
18/07/2017, 10:52:44: sil: why not plan a route that takes in atleast 2 of those peaks?
18/07/2017, 10:53:28: sil: we will only have 7:30 till like 10ish
so gotta make it fairly intensive
18/07/2017, 10:54:15: Rich: I think the 600ft climb will be intense enough
18/07/2017, 10:54:38: Rich: We can always decide to do Hampstead peak and Highgate peak once we're at the part if we feel up to it
18/07/2017, 10:57:37: sil: hmm I sense fear
18/07/2017, 10:58:28: Rich: I find waiting at the top of hills boring
18/07/2017, 11:35:46: sil: me and Alex saw an awesome looking electric mountain  bike in bridgnorth
18/07/2017, 11:35:57: sil: looked it up and it's only like 6grand
18/07/2017, 11:36:04: Rich: He said
18/07/2017, 11:36:26: Rich: I guess it would be good to have some push up the hills
18/07/2017, 11:36:37: sil: you'll be sorry when we constantly dick you
18/07/2017, 11:36:45: sil: on our new bikes
18/07/2017, 11:59:06: Rich: Oh you're actually planning on owning the bike this time?
18/07/2017, 12:10:05: sil: banter is SO last week rich. let's just have some respect for each other.

18/07/2017, 14:17:42: sil: might be worth going into crippling debt just humiliate rich
18/07/2017, 14:18:19: Rich: I don't think I'd feel humiliated if you bought a £15000 bike to beat me up a hill
18/07/2017, 14:18:33: Rich: 💰 🚴

18/07/2017, 20:09:34: James: As far as I can see it's been low tide at banter bay since I left week..
18/07/2017, 20:10:13: James: At least the conversation seems to have finally returned to cycle trip chitchat though
18/07/2017, 20:11:05: James: There seems to a big lump up there about walking a dog or something lol

19/07/2017, 15:22:07: James: You pay a lot for proper brand fully waterproof pannier, I think they are mainly aimed at MAMIL cycledongs who can't afford to get their laptops  wet.
19/07/2017, 15:23:09: James: Good brands that are water resistant often have pop-out waterproof covers that are attached
19/07/2017, 15:23:31: James: And cost 2/3 of the price.
19/07/2017, 15:23:43: sil: shots fired at richs favourite cycling bag brand.....
19/07/2017, 15:24:58: James: Not about the brand, you should go branded if you can afford it, but consider  the intended use class
19/07/2017, 15:25:34: sil: shots fired at richs intended use....
19/07/2017, 15:25:43: James: I went for Outeredge ones as the hangers look like good quality
19/07/2017, 15:26:05: James: Didn't realise Rich cycled to work
19/07/2017, 15:26:24: James: Does it rain much in the lounge?
19/07/2017, 15:26:49: sil: haha NUT
heavy artillery fire!
19/07/2017, 15:30:11: James: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 16:15:12: Rich: I hope it pisses it down
19/07/2017, 16:21:47: sil: richs bag pride has been  mortally wounded
he often sang the praises of his water proof panniers. now he looks like a fool who got mugged off
19/07/2017, 16:23:08: Rich: My bags are great. I've had them 2 years and they've never failed me. If I bought any of your bags my stuff would have got wet on several occasions
19/07/2017, 16:25:26: Rich: One review says they're capacious and sturdy
19/07/2017, 16:25:34: Rich: Just like James' mum
19/07/2017, 16:27:06: sil: rich digs in his defences
19/07/2017, 16:27:16: sil: hes bleeding badly

19/07/2017, 16:34:31: James: Bag down! Bag down!
19/07/2017, 16:34:59: Rich: I'm not falling for that! They're bullet and fire proof
19/07/2017, 16:35:14: James: But not burn proof!
19/07/2017, 16:35:30: James: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 16:36:27: sil: rich maybe you should leave the chat?
19/07/2017, 16:36:37: sil: put yourself out of misery
19/07/2017, 16:37:46: Rich: We'll see who's miserable when you only have wet clothes to wear
19/07/2017, 16:57:04: Alex Brown: My bags are outeredge
19/07/2017, 16:57:12: Alex Brown: The are banter proof
19/07/2017, 16:57:19: Alex Brown: Clearly unlike richs

19/07/2017, 18:02:35: James: Is that second-hand?
19/07/2017, 18:04:44: Alex Brown: I assume so it was made in 1880
19/07/2017, 18:06:18: Alex Brown: I imagine in 140 years it's had some filthy gobs on it
19/07/2017, 18:06:23: Rich: Urgh
19/07/2017, 18:06:39: Alex Brown: I'm gonna sterilise it with liquid serilant
19/07/2017, 18:07:41: Alex Brown: Pretty impressive the original leather is in that condition
19/07/2017, 18:19:17: Alex Brown: It'll be fine when sterilised
19/07/2017, 18:19:42: Alex Brown: Then you can all swing from my antique gob bucket

19/07/2017, 18:56:04: Rich: I imagine it doesn't work as well as a normal tyre
19/07/2017, 18:57:07: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 18:57:26: Alex Brown: All the reviews say they're pretty good
19/07/2017, 18:57:47: Alex Brown: Unless your doing high end stuff
19/07/2017, 19:14:42: Rich: It seems like a good idea
19/07/2017, 19:15:03: sil: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 19:15:05: Rich: I guess the point with regular tyres is that they deform to give extra contact with the toad
19/07/2017, 19:15:11: Rich: I can't imagine those working so well
19/07/2017, 19:15:19: Rich: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 19:15:26: Rich: In the pub like a real lad

19/07/2017, 19:35:47: Alex Brown: 25 quid
19/07/2017, 19:36:01: Alex Brown: Not much
19/07/2017, 19:36:10: Alex Brown: Nicer than tack modern ones
19/07/2017, 19:36:14: Alex Brown: Tacky
19/07/2017, 19:36:49: Alex Brown: And it's proven to last
19/07/2017, 20:35:09: Rich: Does it have years of spirit fume soaked into it?
19/07/2017, 20:35:16: Rich: That's not a bad price
19/07/2017, 20:38:06: Alex Brown: Yeh it's a good price
19/07/2017, 20:38:33: Alex Brown: I touch children

19/07/2017, 20:45:49: Rich: ?

19/07/2017, 20:47:06: Alex Brown: I just drank a bottle of brown sauce
19/07/2017, 20:48:11: Alex Brown: It fuels my paedophilia
19/07/2017, 20:49:39: Alex Brown: I'm not rich any more
19/07/2017, 23:05:17: sil: currently watching the ed Sheran got scene. so arkward. why is he even there.
your favourite show is pretty tacky rich
19/07/2017, 23:05:41: Alex Brown: Very poor
19/07/2017, 23:07:00: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 23:07:26: Alex Brown: I agree I think both the show and Ed sheeran are awful
19/07/2017, 23:07:34: Alex Brown: Why do you watch it sil
19/07/2017, 23:07:46: sil: bryony is currently watching i5
19/07/2017, 23:07:59: sil: I've seen so much GOT
19/07/2017, 23:08:16: Alex Brown: So crap
19/07/2017, 23:08:18: sil: so my thinking it's wank is well Informed
19/07/2017, 23:08:52: Alex Brown: I would do something else
19/07/2017, 23:09:07: Alex Brown: Like scoop my eyeballs out with a spoon
19/07/2017, 23:09:31: Alex Brown: Or any other more enjoyable activity
19/07/2017, 23:09:41: sil: I'm texting loads of bants
19/07/2017, 23:09:49: Alex Brown: Than watch wizards and elves
19/07/2017, 23:10:03: Alex Brown: Doing boring magic
19/07/2017, 23:10:19: sil: that's what I'm doing.
some fat guy isblooking into a fire. probably some witches spell or premonition
19/07/2017, 23:10:34: Alex Brown: Sounds lame
19/07/2017, 23:10:35: sil: he can see a wall. he's having a vision
19/07/2017, 23:10:37: sil: so gay
19/07/2017, 23:11:01: Alex Brown: Bet rich is loving the spell of alderzar being cast
19/07/2017, 23:11:29: sil: it's funny how rich considers himself a man of science and intelect. yet falls for this big budget tripe
19/07/2017, 23:11:30: Alex Brown: It is probably cast over dried dragon ballsack
19/07/2017, 23:12:06: Alex Brown: That is amusing
19/07/2017, 23:12:46: Alex Brown: Maybe rich just loves lame magic
19/07/2017, 23:12:50: sil: gragonzor the great is going to cast a manor spell over the lost valley of trayonor to protect the elves from the goblin king
19/07/2017, 23:14:28: Alex Brown: Is that to stop the goblin King from doing the wicked dance of the forgotten elders?
19/07/2017, 23:17:17: sil: yes!!
but Akron the merciless stole princess calamines dancing shoes. so the must ride a dragon forth to Gannon mountain. I'm literally just watching the scene now where the army of the galor battles the infamous elf horde for control of the mystic sea. sooooo gripping. very high budget.
19/07/2017, 23:17:41: Alex Brown: Wow
19/07/2017, 23:17:51: Alex Brown: Spoiler alert
19/07/2017, 23:17:55: Alex Brown: Oh well
19/07/2017, 23:18:14: Alex Brown: Rich has probably watched that episode 3 times now
19/07/2017, 23:18:27: sil: oops soz guys. it's great cause there are lots of characters. that's how I know it's good writing
19/07/2017, 23:18:43: Alex Brown: Hopefully he will learn the spell that makes his peers respect him
19/07/2017, 23:18:51: sil: Anyone can write 10 characters. that's easy
19/07/2017, 23:18:57: Alex Brown: NUT
19/07/2017, 23:20:06: sil: <‎image omitted>
19/07/2017, 23:32:21: Alex Brown: Skyrim is way cooler
19/07/2017, 23:32:35: Alex Brown: The dragons are way more believable
19/07/2017, 23:32:44: Alex Brown: Especially the ice ones
19/07/2017, 23:33:24: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 09:13:47: sil: it would be funny ed Sheran turns out to be the hero and slays all the dragons to become the winner of the throne game and the ruler of all westeros
20/07/2017, 09:14:31: Rich: Did you watch the whole episode?
20/07/2017, 09:14:41: Rich: The ed sheeran bit is very painful
20/07/2017, 09:15:00: Rich: They have his face out of focus in almost every shot
20/07/2017, 09:15:26: sil: literally entered the room during that scene. why was he so in focus for a background character?
20/07/2017, 09:15:47: sil: he was in every shot
20/07/2017, 09:15:52: Rich: Super painful.
20/07/2017, 09:16:42: Rich: The episode was just a big list of reminders of the plot, one cheap win and a handful of contrived plot devices to put characters in the right places
20/07/2017, 10:47:08: Alex Brown: Is this a new food craze?
20/07/2017, 10:47:08: Alex Brown: It seems to be on every menu
20/07/2017, 10:47:10: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 10:47:48: Rich: Still better than eating off a plate coated with stale saliva
20/07/2017, 10:49:47: sil: I imagine every meal Alex cooks contains fecal matter with the way he man handles his food
20/07/2017, 11:37:10: Rich: It's definitely a key component in his salad dressing
20/07/2017, 11:37:46: Rich: 2 parts mayonnaise, 1 part cheese, 300 parts per million fecal matter
20/07/2017, 13:52:14: James: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 13:53:13: Rich: I bet you and alex will be doing some role play in your tent
20/07/2017, 13:53:17: Rich: Eh eh!
20/07/2017, 13:56:07: sil: double glazing AND plumbing services!?
incredible
20/07/2017, 14:05:21: Rich: Just over two weeks to go!
20/07/2017, 14:05:57: Rich: Everyone take swimming shorts so we can go swim in a lake we're hopefully camping near
20/07/2017, 14:06:13: Rich: What day next week are we going training?
20/07/2017, 14:12:55: sil: wed?
20/07/2017, 14:17:02: Rich: Can do
20/07/2017, 14:18:48: Rich: Maybe Tuesday would be better so we can do band Wednesday?
20/07/2017, 14:19:20: Rich: Can't decide what to say James?
20/07/2017, 14:19:56: James: We were going to recreate some scenes from Pulp Fiction - Alex thought you might want to play Marcellus?
20/07/2017, 14:19:58: Rich: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 14:20:16: Rich: Sounds entertaining
20/07/2017, 14:20:31: Rich: Alex looks beefy
20/07/2017, 14:20:51: sil: I have no preference really. whenever is good for me.
thinking to save some time by driving to work with my bike in back of car. then I can get bike out and cycle to regents park for 6:30
20/07/2017, 14:20:52: sil: then get the train into work next day
20/07/2017, 14:20:58: sil: regents park being the halfway point
20/07/2017, 14:21:16: Rich: Yeah that could work
20/07/2017, 14:21:30: Rich: Alternatively we could start from Victoria and meet you near yours
20/07/2017, 14:21:54: Rich: The loop I picked goes sort of near each of our houses so we can hop on and off
20/07/2017, 14:22:27: sil: it's take me an hour to get home.
half an hour to regents park
20/07/2017, 14:22:37: Rich: Oh ok yeah let's do that then
20/07/2017, 14:22:41: sil: if we meet near mine might as well just go home first
20/07/2017, 14:22:50: Rich: What time would you and alex be ready james?
20/07/2017, 14:22:58: sil: do which one?
20/07/2017, 14:23:07: sil: meet regents park or near my home?
20/07/2017, 14:23:11: Rich: Erm meet in Regent's Park I guess
20/07/2017, 14:23:34: Rich: Although it depends when alex and james can be ready by
20/07/2017, 14:24:24: sil: yeah. well either is fine. we can start in reemgents park at 6.30
or I can leave mine at like 7.15
20/07/2017, 14:25:15: Rich: If alex and james can be ready by 6 then we could cycle over to regents and meet you at 6:30
20/07/2017, 14:25:25: Rich: Else you could cycle our way a bit if you get bored
20/07/2017, 14:36:15: Alex Brown: No we have jobs rich
20/07/2017, 14:36:37: Rich: What time do you get home?
20/07/2017, 14:38:33: sil: Alex's finish work at 5:30. it takes him about 25mins to get home
20/07/2017, 14:38:47: sil: he could be home just before 6
20/07/2017, 14:38:54: Rich: That was my assumption
20/07/2017, 14:50:45: James: It takes a little longer, if we left dead on 530 we could be home for 610.
20/07/2017, 14:51:33: Rich: I guess we have to factor in turn around too so we'd likely be at reagents park by something like 7pm
20/07/2017, 14:51:37: James: Back out the door by 630 after getting changed etc.
20/07/2017, 14:51:45: Rich: Yeah
20/07/2017, 14:53:11: sil: alright. guess it's probably best to meet somewhere near mine at 7.15
20/07/2017, 14:54:28: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Hereford+Rd,+London+E3+2FR/51.5622194,-0.0767393/@51.5617926,-0.0883046,14.23z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x48761d39370220bb:0xd2a4f14956fc874e!2m2!1d-0.0274512!2d51.5302675!1m0!3e1?hl=en

20/07/2017, 15:46:46: Alex Brown: Something has to be good in the first place to be ruined

20/07/2017, 15:48:28: sil: ok I've figured out how to copy counts like that now
20/07/2017, 15:48:36: sil: comments
20/07/2017, 15:48:44: Rich: ok I've figured out how to copy counts like that now
20/07/2017, 15:48:49: Rich: How?
20/07/2017, 15:48:53: sil: no you havnt
20/07/2017, 15:48:58: Rich: It's funny that we both tried to do that at once
20/07/2017, 15:49:02: sil: haha
20/07/2017, 15:49:11: sil: you are gay
20/07/2017, 15:49:48: Rich: You are gay
20/07/2017, 15:50:15: sil: this is a useful tool.
gonna be very annoying
20/07/2017, 15:50:37: sil: Alex at his most pedantic
20/07/2017, 15:50:39: Rich: Yeah it will be
20/07/2017, 15:51:37: Rich: I think some fairly mid rate structures have been ruined. E.g. Everything alex has worked on
20/07/2017, 15:52:16: sil: Alex has obviously been told off by Nicola today. he's grumpy and sensitive
20/07/2017, 15:53:55: Rich: Or his boss
20/07/2017, 15:54:16: sil: the 2 things Alex fears most
20/07/2017, 16:02:48: sil: actually the thing Alex fears most is staying at someone house and only realising in the morning that they only have low fat mayonnaise to accompany breakfast
20/07/2017, 16:08:16: sil: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 16:08:47: Rich: Last I heard nobody else was even running
20/07/2017, 16:08:56: Rich: Good news though. Vince is great
20/07/2017, 16:09:26: sil: yeah it's alright. 
not the most progressive move for the lib dems tho
20/07/2017, 16:09:53: Rich: What do you mean?
20/07/2017, 16:10:36: sil: I can't see vince cable pushing the party's appeal beyond it's current support base
20/07/2017, 16:11:30: Rich: Hmm. I think he's quite credible. And a lot of their base didn't really vote for them in the last election
20/07/2017, 16:11:49: Rich: I think for the lib dems it's more about recovering their floating voters than getting new ones
20/07/2017, 16:12:21: James: All seven of them
20/07/2017, 16:12:23: James: 😆
20/07/2017, 16:14:02: sil: hi James. what is your source for that figure?
20/07/2017, 16:14:18: sil: <‎image omitted>
20/07/2017, 16:14:59: sil: doesn't seem to correspond with these figures taken from the guardian, June 2017
20/07/2017, 16:15:04: Rich: I guess he meant all 7% of the electorate
20/07/2017, 16:16:40: sil: in that case his miscalculation was a grammatical one and not a statistical one. both heinous crimes.
20/07/2017, 16:18:54: Rich: He'll know better than to carelessly quote political statistics in the future
20/07/2017, 16:22:18: James: I'll think you'll find it corresponds just fine.
20/07/2017, 16:23:39: sil: I see no 7
20/07/2017, 16:23:59: sil: I do see a 7.37 however
20/07/2017, 16:24:31: Rich: I think we'll let him round it
20/07/2017, 16:24:46: Rich: Else you should be quoting 7.369844533%
20/07/2017, 16:24:57: sil: is that correct?
20/07/2017, 16:25:17: sil: have you just falsified statistics!?!
20/07/2017, 16:25:41: sil: this is literally how fake news happens
20/07/2017, 16:27:13: Rich: Sorry 😐

20/07/2017, 16:37:58: James: Do you not have work to be doing?
20/07/2017, 16:38:59: sil: and what is your job today?

20/07/2017, 23:22:20: James: I might tow it if the 20litres of water for the shower proves too voluminous.
20/07/2017, 23:23:24: James: Depends on how much Alex's top bag weighs

25/07/2017, 13:41:38: Alex Brown: A healthy balanced diet is very important
25/07/2017, 13:41:59: Alex Brown: Mayonnaise
25/07/2017, 13:42:05: Alex Brown: Is a blight
25/07/2017, 13:42:12: Alex Brown: On society

25/07/2017, 14:01:32: Alex Brown: EBay has no register of it
25/07/2017, 14:01:40: Rich: But won't load it unnecessarily
25/07/2017, 14:01:43: Rich: That was silly alex
25/07/2017, 14:01:46: sil: hahaha
25/07/2017, 14:01:49: Alex Brown: Unless I did it as guest
25/07/2017, 14:02:03: sil: atleast James will have a lighter load now

25/07/2017, 18:31:21: Alex Brown: James's the money came out of my account so it must be in your emails
25/07/2017, 18:31:38: Alex Brown: I guess I used your ebay
25/07/2017, 18:31:50: Alex Brown: Shit almost bought another tent then
25/07/2017, 18:32:07: Alex Brown: It dropped by 30 on decathlon this week
25/07/2017, 18:36:45: Alex Brown: <‎video omitted>
25/07/2017, 18:37:24: Alex Brown: This video is missing the part where I stand around being annoying whilst someone else puts up the tent
25/07/2017, 18:37:30: Rich: Don't forget to tap the pole and hole before you insert it
25/07/2017, 18:37:44: Rich: I guess that someone else is james
25/07/2017, 18:38:19: Rich: It also misses the part where sil and I smuggle sit in our complete tent whilst james struggles with your ten
25/07/2017, 18:42:36: Rich: I'm setting off in a minute
25/07/2017, 18:42:41: Rich: You ready james?

25/07/2017, 18:44:41: Rich: Nicola can't stop you drinking when you're in the pub with us
25/07/2017, 18:44:43: Alex Brown: What's a Stoke newington
25/07/2017, 18:44:59: Alex Brown: Shouldn't we be in Victoria park
25/07/2017, 18:45:03: Rich: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Hereford+Road,+London/51.558026,-0.0902/@51.5468056,-0.0734416,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x48761d39370220bb:0xd2a4f14956fc874e!2m2!1d-0.0275636!2d51.5303665!1m0!3e1?hl=en
25/07/2017, 18:45:04: Alex Brown: That's the deal
25/07/2017, 18:45:13: Rich: No sil is the last ready so we're meeting at his
25/07/2017, 18:45:26: Rich: Cause he has the longest commute
25/07/2017, 18:46:05: Alex Brown: Um no that's silly
25/07/2017, 18:46:14: Alex Brown: 30mins
25/07/2017, 18:46:24: Alex Brown: That's a whole ride in itself
25/07/2017, 18:46:36: Alex Brown: London is dangerous
25/07/2017, 18:46:42: Alex Brown: Very dangerous
25/07/2017, 18:47:06: Alex Brown: I think we'll just cycle around my safe space approved area
25/07/2017, 19:01:09: Rich: I'm sorry to tell you alex, but james Dan and I have agreed that it's probably best if you give the ride to southwold a miss
25/07/2017, 19:01:38: Rich: We don't want to put your body under any more strain when you're going through such a difficult time anyway
25/07/2017, 19:01:55: Rich: We thought maybe if you can tonight it would be alright, but clearly you can't cut it
25/07/2017, 19:09:01: Alex Brown: On way 25,min
25/07/2017, 22:01:22: sil: well this guy is fucking ruining our nice ride
25/07/2017, 22:07:04: James: Waste of skin
25/07/2017, 22:07:21: James: But what do I know I'm a plebiscite...
25/07/2017, 22:22:36: sil: such a jerk
25/07/2017, 22:23:10: sil: he took a disliking to you James
25/07/2017, 22:25:02: Rich: Yeah what a cunt
25/07/2017, 22:25:08: Rich: That was super awkward
25/07/2017, 22:25:24: Rich: He plonked himself down without a word and started minesweeping
25/07/2017, 22:25:43: Rich: At first I thought he was just a pathetic sleeman type but turns out he was a massive cunt
25/07/2017, 22:26:22: sil: he was pretty fucked
25/07/2017, 22:26:25: sil: still a jerk tho
25/07/2017, 22:27:25: sil: and that's why cycling in the country is alot better!
25/07/2017, 22:32:03: Rich: Yeah
25/07/2017, 22:42:58: Alex Brown: He was an alcoholic with mental illness
25/07/2017, 22:43:14: Alex Brown: James almost got me knifed outsidetesco
25/07/2017, 22:43:19: Alex Brown: The daft cunt
25/07/2017, 22:46:31: Rich: What by another alcoholic?
25/07/2017, 22:46:56: Alex Brown: No 3 kids circleing the car park
25/07/2017, 22:50:58: Alex Brown: Hahaha
25/07/2017, 22:51:00: Alex Brown: Rich
25/07/2017, 22:51:17: Alex Brown: I couldn't stop thinking how much he sounded like your dad
25/07/2017, 22:51:24: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>

25/07/2017, 22:52:26: James: Anyone want to sleep in a squat?
25/07/2017, 22:53:25: Rich: I'd love to sleep in squat
25/07/2017, 22:53:34: Rich: Actually I have been to a squat and it was fun
25/07/2017, 22:54:01: Rich: I guess that's why I could understand what he was saying
25/07/2017, 22:55:02: Alex Brown: Oh yeh you are a plebacite
25/07/2017, 22:55:31: Alex Brown: Did it feel like you were talking to your dad about your apps

25/07/2017, 23:18:45: Alex Brown: It'll be worth it when I have 4 days worth of battery
25/07/2017, 23:28:08: James: You need to cancel that asap before it's dispatched.
25/07/2017, 23:28:45: James: A 20000 mAh power bank costs the same and will charge your phone 8 times
25/07/2017, 23:29:44: James: 8 days of battery
25/07/2017, 23:29:55: James: Or 4 double days
25/07/2017, 23:31:50: James: And I thought you already had a bike phone adapter fitted to your bike?
25/07/2017, 23:32:36: Alex Brown: That's what I'm getting as a case

25/07/2017, 23:34:08: Alex Brown: It's badman james
25/07/2017, 23:34:18: James: Such a fashion victim..
25/07/2017, 23:34:50: Alex Brown: Plebacite
25/07/2017, 23:35:16: James: It's 3 1/2 star rating does not fill me with confidence....
25/07/2017, 23:35:38: James: And the quad lock is even worse...
25/07/2017, 23:35:50: Alex Brown: Hmmm
25/07/2017, 23:35:52: Alex Brown: Cute
25/07/2017, 23:35:59: Alex Brown: I've had one before
25/07/2017, 23:36:07: Alex Brown: It's worth the moolah
25/07/2017, 23:36:27: James: But these are just the words of a 'daft cunt'... do what you thinks best
25/07/2017, 23:36:35: Alex Brown: After being stuck stopping every 5min today
25/07/2017, 23:36:50: Alex Brown: Oh that is true james
25/07/2017, 23:37:11: Alex Brown: He did say that
25/07/2017, 23:37:21: James: Can you not use your existing mount then?
25/07/2017, 23:37:27: Alex Brown: He wasn't happy about your birthday
25/07/2017, 23:37:31: Alex Brown: Yep
25/07/2017, 23:37:37: Alex Brown: It's a quad lock
25/07/2017, 23:37:43: James: It was plebiscital
25/07/2017, 23:37:58: James: And cake is daft
25/07/2017, 23:38:07: James: Everyone knows that
25/07/2017, 23:38:10: Alex Brown: Cake is clearly daft
25/07/2017, 23:38:18: Alex Brown: Anyway I must bed
25/07/2017, 23:38:57: James: Heh - 'Two Pints Brown' is out for the count.....

26/07/2017, 08:48:49: James: 16.2 plebimeters by my count
26/07/2017, 08:51:22: Rich: Yeah the full loop would have been 20 so james is about right give or take a couple of microplebs
26/07/2017, 08:57:59: Rich: <‎image omitted>
26/07/2017, 09:27:40: James: <‎image omitted>
26/07/2017, 09:28:10: James: LOL - Love it.
26/07/2017, 09:43:44: sil: 20 miles for one evening is good. were gonna have ample time to get to southwald on roads I reckon
26/07/2017, 10:27:09: Rich: Basically we have to do that ride twice a day for three days
26/07/2017, 10:27:51: Alex Brown: Yeh
26/07/2017, 10:27:57: Alex Brown: You get tired
26/07/2017, 10:28:05: Alex Brown: And we will be alot heavier
26/07/2017, 10:34:42: Rich: It'll be tough but doable
26/07/2017, 10:36:23: sil: I am very disappointed in one area I felt we trained I adequately in.
26/07/2017, 10:36:23: sil: 2 pints is pretty shocking
26/07/2017, 10:36:24: sil: gonna have to up our game
26/07/2017, 10:40:38: Rich: We did all drink the second one fairly quickly...
26/07/2017, 10:48:39: sil: that's alright
26/07/2017, 10:48:40: sil: might be a struggle for Alex though
26/07/2017, 11:14:15: Alex Brown: That's what I said
26/07/2017, 11:14:29: Alex Brown: We should of had another at the Spaniards
26/07/2017, 11:14:44: Alex Brown: Instead of the awkward pint at the nd
26/07/2017, 11:17:17: Alex Brown: We should do jaeger and liquid morphine bombs
26/07/2017, 11:17:36: Alex Brown: That would be rad
26/07/2017, 11:18:21: Alex Brown: James I'm worried about that tent
26/07/2017, 11:18:31: Alex Brown: Check wagwan on your ebay
26/07/2017, 11:18:36: Alex Brown: Or in your emails
26/07/2017, 11:18:48: Alex Brown: Rich I'm also worried about new year

26/07/2017, 11:26:12: Rich: That would be cool
26/07/2017, 11:26:27: Rich: But maybe a bit close to the trip?

26/07/2017, 14:11:33: Alex Brown: I find it so sad you guys feel the need to insult an athlete at the top of his game
26/07/2017, 14:12:01: Alex Brown: Because you're all so self conscious about your fitness ability
26/07/2017, 14:12:11: Alex Brown: I find it so cute
26/07/2017, 14:13:28: sil: in psychology Alex, they call this sort of display "projecting"

26/07/2017, 16:00:27: Rich: Sure
26/07/2017, 16:01:00: Rich: It is pretty late to be training but I guess it will help
26/07/2017, 16:01:42: ‎You changed this group's icon
26/07/2017, 16:16:46: James: Although it might just give everyone sore knees and palms, perineum etc. right before the trip? Need to allow a bit of healing time before riding out, as per a standard long distance event..
26/07/2017, 16:17:13: Rich: Mm
26/07/2017, 16:17:17: James: Definitely still up for another ride though
26/07/2017, 16:17:23: Rich: Should really taper training from two weeks prior
26/07/2017, 16:17:32: Rich: I guess we could do an easier one
26/07/2017, 16:17:55: James: I suppose we are going to suffer anyway so it doesn't make too much difference
26/07/2017, 16:18:57: James: The fun of drinking and meeting your lovely London Fields mates outweighs all of my aches
26/07/2017, 16:19:21: Rich: Such charming company
26/07/2017, 16:21:06: James: A real selection of London's finest yesterday  - spoilt wags, bleeding chavs, aggressive motorists, spaced out druggies and opinionated  alcoholics...
26/07/2017, 16:21:33: James: Maybe we should just ride around the north circular instead?
26/07/2017, 16:22:07: James: Oh and dead-eyed smack heads and feral children for us to finish
26/07/2017, 16:23:12: sil: and Alex is like 3 of those things in 1
26/07/2017, 16:24:45: Rich: I'd say the bleeding guy was a punk not a chav
26/07/2017, 16:25:24: Rich: Although the worries girls fleeing the scene were chavs and so presumably was the other combatant who may or may not have been bleeding
26/07/2017, 16:27:44: James: See I thought punk, but the gf was chav
26/07/2017, 16:28:08: Rich: She wouldn't be hurrying away if she were the girlfriend of the man on the ground
26/07/2017, 16:28:31: James: Although I had a better gawp at his mates and they were very 'alternative'

28/07/2017, 10:20:54: Alex Brown: Yeh great for the bike trip
28/07/2017, 10:21:21: Rich: Solar charger on the pannier with a cable to my phone in its travel mount
28/07/2017, 10:21:23: Alex Brown: I can use my battery pack to charge ecig/speaker
28/07/2017, 10:21:26: Alex Brown: Nice
28/07/2017, 10:21:29: Rich: Sweet
28/07/2017, 10:21:50: Alex Brown: Not waste it on my phone which is a mega power drain
28/07/2017, 10:22:06: Alex Brown: And it also doubles as a bike attachable case
28/07/2017, 10:22:30: Alex Brown: With will be great for music / satnav
28/07/2017, 10:23:15: Alex Brown: I won't be able to do any wheelies tho
28/07/2017, 10:23:27: Alex Brown: With a brick on the front of my bike
28/07/2017, 10:23:45: Rich: That's a shame
28/07/2017, 10:23:52: Rich: You're normally so good at wheelies
28/07/2017, 10:24:04: Rich: But yeah more battery is always good battery
28/07/2017, 10:24:10: Rich: We're going to be tricked out for this ride
28/07/2017, 10:24:21: Rich: Except james who is bringing a stupid shower bag
28/07/2017, 10:24:36: Alex Brown: I dropped my bike in for a service today
28/07/2017, 10:24:43: Alex Brown: NUT
28/07/2017, 10:24:50: Alex Brown: Shots fired
28/07/2017, 10:25:01: Alex Brown: James is bleeding out
28/07/2017, 10:25:56: Rich: 🚿 💼 = ❌
28/07/2017, 10:26:04: Rich: Full service?
28/07/2017, 10:26:25: Rich: Is this the first bike ride that you haven't allowed you brother to damage your bike just ahead of?
28/07/2017, 10:29:50: sil: Rich is nalpalming indiscriminately
28/07/2017, 10:29:56: sil: carpet bomb
28/07/2017, 10:30:53: sil: Alex, I guess you can afford to have a heavy phone. seeming as you guys are saving weight on not even having a tent
28/07/2017, 10:31:40: sil: does the battery pack have a shelter extension?
28/07/2017, 10:31:59: sil: I'm joining richs bombing campaign
28/07/2017, 10:33:08: Rich: Those are flames not even water can extinguish!
28/07/2017, 10:33:26: Rich: Looks like james and alex are going to be sleeping in an Argos child's tent
28/07/2017, 10:33:32: Rich: ⛺️ 👶
28/07/2017, 10:33:39: Rich: Tent ⛺️ 👶 👶
28/07/2017, 10:33:38: James: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 10:33:46: sil: wouldn't be the first time Alex has pitched a child's tent
28/07/2017, 10:35:45: Alex Brown: Cute
28/07/2017, 10:37:02: sil: literally cleared th3 bottle field with 0 resistance. you guys are Poland
28/07/2017, 10:37:13: sil: we blitzed
28/07/2017, 10:38:19: James: I suppose you are able to move so rapidly across the terrain due the fact you're not carrying *anything*
28/07/2017, 10:38:57: James: Even your vehicle is weightless given it's imaginary...
28/07/2017, 10:39:29: sil: sorry James. I think someone's filled your banter gun with blanks
28/07/2017, 10:39:40: James: Good luck carrying 100% of the gear @447858386777
28/07/2017, 10:39:53: sil: or you've picked up a water pistol.
turn it on yourself
28/07/2017, 10:39:59: sil: you can use it as a shower then
28/07/2017, 10:40:07: James: I can't.
28/07/2017, 10:40:20: James: Needs to lie in the sun for 4h first.
28/07/2017, 10:40:33: James: Nut
28/07/2017, 10:41:32: James: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 10:41:56: sil: James just commited suicide
28/07/2017, 10:42:07: sil: such a shame
28/07/2017, 11:19:16: Rich: Sad.
28/07/2017, 11:21:41: sil: such a young Lad. had so many bants ahead
28/07/2017, 11:28:24: James: Sounds like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders... well, better get used to it as it will be heavier next week!
28/07/2017, 11:30:51: James: You sound pretty down, it's a shame you don't have anyone to share that burden with... Surely you could split it equally with Sil? Oh wait you can't. You'll have to carry it *all* by yourself.
28/07/2017, 11:32:28: sil: ?
not really sure what your getting at
28/07/2017, 11:32:37: sil: I carry the tent
28/07/2017, 11:32:54: Rich: I just have to take poles
28/07/2017, 11:32:55: sil: and rich is kind enough to help me with the poles
28/07/2017, 11:33:10: sil: Alex has burdened you with an entire tent
28/07/2017, 11:33:11: Rich: Provided sil has capacity for food and booze were all good
28/07/2017, 11:33:28: sil: yes, I will bring a practically empty back pack
28/07/2017, 11:33:31: Rich: I think as a pair we'll have the far more streamlined load
28/07/2017, 11:33:42: Rich: Carefully crafted kit
28/07/2017, 11:34:06: sil: while you guys have a kitchen sink and bathroom unit
28/07/2017, 11:35:32: James: Hah - gay
28/07/2017, 11:36:09: James: Poppers at the ready eh?
28/07/2017, 11:37:44: James: Sil not bringing any kit? Yep sounds about right.
28/07/2017, 11:39:13: James: Glamping over camping makes for a better trip
28/07/2017, 11:40:19: James: Being so muscular and fit means we don't have to worry about such trivial matters such as 'kgs'
28/07/2017, 11:41:55: James: We're bringing some kettle bells to slow us down so you guy's can keep up 💪🏻🏋🏻‍♀
28/07/2017, 11:48:31: sil: yes. alex. always ahead of the pack when cycling.
28/07/2017, 11:52:34: James: You're both adults. If you've agreed between yourselves that Rich will take 100% of the weight and Sil will take *absolutely nothing* then that's totally cool. Me and Alex are splitting the load  equally but that's just our equally valid way of doing things.
28/07/2017, 11:53:31: James: Horse's for courses eh?
28/07/2017, 11:53:47: sil: i guess a non exsistant tent is pretty easy to split
28/07/2017, 11:54:07: James: About as easy as an imaginary bike
28/07/2017, 11:54:15: sil: you can print of the delivery confirmation and use that as shelter
28/07/2017, 11:54:26: Rich: LOL
28/07/2017, 11:54:53: James: It might overload us, can you carry it in your empty backpack?
28/07/2017, 11:54:57: Rich: The great thing about nothing is that no matter which way you divide it you always get equal shares
28/07/2017, 11:55:37: sil: my empty back pack is for all the supplies that we buy from shops en route.
my camping stuff is strapped to the 2 large bags on my bike
28/07/2017, 11:57:23: sil: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 11:58:54: James: You mad bro?
28/07/2017, 11:59:14: James: Oh yeah, you mad 😆
28/07/2017, 12:00:22: James: I hope that's not a carbon fibre seat post?
28/07/2017, 12:01:50: sil: aluminium I believe
28/07/2017, 12:03:03: James: Cool cool. Wouldn't want it to unexpectedly snap from that poorly attached load.
28/07/2017, 12:05:35: sil: oh James. it's daddy's bike. it's all VERY expensive
28/07/2017, 12:06:18: James: Nice pencil case on the front btw
28/07/2017, 12:07:20: James: Are you planning on doing many dirt jumps on this trip?
28/07/2017, 12:07:48: James: It would be very well suited if you are
28/07/2017, 12:09:00: James: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 12:09:14: sil: no. but the option is there. thank both the front fork suspension and the middle frame suspension are adjustable at the flick of a switch
28/07/2017, 12:09:52: sil: meaning daddy's bike is adaptable for all terrain
28/07/2017, 12:12:23: sil: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 12:14:41: James: So you've borrowed a bike and Rich is taking all the stuff. Are you bringing anything of your own on this trip?
28/07/2017, 12:16:23: sil: kind of unsure what you think rich is taking
28/07/2017, 12:16:56: sil: I think your projecting
28/07/2017, 12:17:21: sil: let me find the psychology i provised for Alex...
28/07/2017, 12:17:59: sil: 1
28/07/2017, 12:20:18: sil: when your tent arrives. I recommend it fair that Alex takes atleast the poles
28/07/2017, 12:30:20: James: Hmm wouldn't be so sure about that...
28/07/2017, 12:30:42: James: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 12:31:39: James: @447753461116 How well do you know Darek?
28/07/2017, 12:34:48: sil: haha uh oh....
28/07/2017, 12:37:18: James: @447753461116 Do you remember if the item location was UK?
28/07/2017, 12:39:24: James: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 12:44:52: Rich: Way to buy a tent guys
28/07/2017, 12:53:17: sil: eBay isn't the best place to buy a tent
28/07/2017, 12:53:26: sil: you may have to go i store
28/07/2017, 12:53:36: sil: go find a blacks or something in town

28/07/2017, 13:12:49: James: Rather have two than none
28/07/2017, 13:13:29: James: Decathlon can go back easier

28/07/2017, 13:28:02: James: Most certainly! Although we have only just exchanged and are still waiting to complete.....
28/07/2017, 13:28:45: Alex Brown: James our hard earned cash is on the line here

28/07/2017, 13:35:12: sil: this is the guy who claims to be the best at cycling??
28/07/2017, 13:35:52: sil: also Alex. you should go buy the tent together
28/07/2017, 13:35:59: sil: why push that duty on James?
28/07/2017, 13:36:20: sil: I think if you make James buy it, you should carry it
28/07/2017, 13:40:23: Alex Brown: I'm cooking us all a meal tonight and away tmoz
28/07/2017, 13:40:33: Alex Brown: But I can got with on tues

28/07/2017, 13:45:54: Alex Brown: Chillis
28/07/2017, 13:45:55: Rich: LOL

28/07/2017, 13:46:10: sil: fired
28/07/2017, 13:46:17: Alex Brown: Rich is getting a free ride off u sil
28/07/2017, 13:46:33: Alex Brown: I'd make him carry the whole tent
28/07/2017, 13:46:52: Alex Brown: Did he pay for half of it.?
28/07/2017, 13:47:09: Alex Brown: I don't think so
28/07/2017, 13:47:23: Alex Brown: Has he foiled our plans to buy nos
28/07/2017, 13:47:24: Alex Brown: Yes
28/07/2017, 13:47:41: Rich: You can't drive a wedge between us
28/07/2017, 13:47:59: Rich: we could use my tent instead but we elected to use Sil's as it is lighter
28/07/2017, 13:47:51: Alex Brown: He needs some of the burden we are all carrying
28/07/2017, 13:48:09: Rich: we think carefully about our packing choices
28/07/2017, 13:48:19: Rich: no stupid ass shower bags for us
28/07/2017, 13:48:27: Alex Brown: Ooo
28/07/2017, 13:48:36: Rich: sorry Alex but I'm unable to share you alcholism
28/07/2017, 13:48:37: Alex Brown: Redirecting fire to james
28/07/2017, 13:48:47: Alex Brown: James is innocent
28/07/2017, 13:49:06: Alex Brown: But you deffo should carry more tent
28/07/2017, 13:49:40: Alex Brown: Rich is feeling the pressure of having to serve his duty
28/07/2017, 13:49:59: Rich: I think we've found a fair division of labour actually
28/07/2017, 13:49:59: Alex Brown: Make him take the tent sil
28/07/2017, 13:50:11: Alex Brown: He has two big pannier bags
28/07/2017, 13:50:20: Rich: Pole + rest is as equally as you could split the lid
28/07/2017, 13:50:22: Rich: Load
28/07/2017, 13:50:23: Alex Brown: And a rack that you don't have
28/07/2017, 13:50:42: Rich: And waterproof bags that you don't have
28/07/2017, 13:50:55: Alex Brown: Do you have a financial stake in that tent rich?
28/07/2017, 13:51:12: Alex Brown: Less financial stake=more load
28/07/2017, 13:51:33: Alex Brown: Me and james will share the tent eaqually
28/07/2017, 13:51:44: Alex Brown: I shall take the poles
28/07/2017, 13:51:56: Alex Brown: James will take the bag and canvas
28/07/2017, 13:52:06: Alex Brown: We split cost equally
28/07/2017, 13:52:37: Alex Brown: You are also profiting off my free music load
28/07/2017, 13:53:00: Alex Brown: Therefore you must take supplies
28/07/2017, 13:53:13: Alex Brown: And more tent
28/07/2017, 13:53:19: Alex Brown: It's only fair
28/07/2017, 13:55:17: sil: rich has been very reasonable
28/07/2017, 13:55:39: sil: im taking a bag for mine and richs supplies
28/07/2017, 13:57:15: sil: "James is gonna carry the tent. I've got a good deal here, don't ruin it"
- Alex Brown, last week
28/07/2017, 13:57:50: Alex Brown: Instigating lies
28/07/2017, 13:58:20: sil: he said that last Thursday when he stayed at mine the night before bens wedding
28/07/2017, 13:58:21: Rich: Thank you sil
28/07/2017, 13:58:34: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
28/07/2017, 13:58:36: Rich: I think alex is just trying to cover his own cowardice by accusing others
28/07/2017, 13:58:56: Rich: At least that kind of paneer is waterproof
28/07/2017, 13:59:21: Alex Brown: Like my paneer bag
28/07/2017, 13:59:28: sil: who's bringing the bodybags?
cus these guys been murdered
28/07/2017, 14:00:14: Alex Brown: Lies will get you no where
28/07/2017, 14:00:39: Rich: No they won't will they alex?
28/07/2017, 14:02:03: Alex Brown: I'm taking half the tent
28/07/2017, 14:04:47: sil: great. peer pressure works. I'm glad you saw sense to being fair
28/07/2017, 14:05:34: Rich: Looks like our job here is done

30/07/2017, 22:22:18: Rich: True dat
30/07/2017, 22:22:19: Alex Brown: We aren't doing the rounds thing
30/07/2017, 22:22:31: Rich: I guess if they each buy a round tomorrow night we're even
30/07/2017, 22:22:33: Alex Brown: It's a different bike trio
30/07/2017, 22:22:49: Alex Brown: I'm not rising tomorrow

30/07/2017, 22:23:21: Rich: That doesn't bode well for the ride
30/07/2017, 22:23:21: Alex Brown: It's too close

30/07/2017, 22:26:02: sil: richs homeless London dad
30/07/2017, 22:26:04: James: It's either me or Alex's round. I don't mind getting the next one. I probably won't get one for your mate though as he was a bit stand-offish with me the other night.
30/07/2017, 22:26:15: Rich: Haha
30/07/2017, 22:26:25: sil: he will have the dregs
30/07/2017, 22:26:37: Rich: I think he may have been annoyed when sil brought out four pints and didn't give him one
30/07/2017, 22:26:57: sil: haha I didn't know he was even there till I came out
30/07/2017, 22:26:59: sil: what a weirdo
30/07/2017, 22:27:30: sil: although if we take him instead of Alex we might not have to wait at top of hills as much. and we will have better drugs
30/07/2017, 22:27:52: Rich: That poor girl he numbed a fag off was so desperate to make him go away that she gave her lit cigarette to
Him
30/07/2017, 22:28:01: Rich: That's true
30/07/2017, 22:28:23: Rich: I bet if that guy buys drugs rather than saying he would have done
30/07/2017, 22:28:29: James: It was a tactical move - don't want to lose a whole one.
30/07/2017, 22:28:49: Alex Brown: ..
30/07/2017, 22:29:21: sil: Alex says "oh yeah I nearly got some good drugs. but oh well these poppers will do guy! "

30/07/2017, 23:00:36: sil: it's fun to pretend that Alex is racist to Asians
30/07/2017, 23:00:55: sil: it's kinda meta racism
30/07/2017, 23:02:19: sil: the fun isn't in the racism
30/07/2017, 23:02:27: sil: it's in the making Alex look racist
30/07/2017, 23:26:43: James: Not sure he needs the help lol
30/07/2017, 23:27:13: sil: well, it's very low hanging fruit for fun

31/07/2017, 10:55:34: Rich: It's probably time to pivot from Bants to Plans
31/07/2017, 11:04:37: James: Not yet. Some time in the next few days - depending on whether this thing arrives today or not, and whether it looks legit.
31/07/2017, 11:05:42: James: Niiice. Was going to suggest a shared list. I have one in excel - will review.

31/07/2017, 11:11:46: Rich: You can never be completely orthogonal to bants
31/07/2017, 11:15:26: Alex Brown: Experience shows rich is perpendicular to the a bants line
31/07/2017, 11:15:53: Rich: I'm totally bant-aligned
31/07/2017, 11:15:55: Alex Brown: And he is also 120 miles off cette line e

01/08/2017, 09:23:51: James: How many poles are broken?
01/08/2017, 09:29:53: sil: maybe you won't need that shower after all James
01/08/2017, 09:30:59: Alex Brown: Yeh it's in a fucking decathlon wrapper

01/08/2017, 09:35:49: Rich: Is it fucked?

01/08/2017, 09:42:14: James: Suggest we pick up a proper tent from decathalon and then tell this guy to arrange a courier to collect his bag of jazz via courier. Thoughts?
01/08/2017, 09:44:12: James: It's probably been used as a trampoline + no proper guarantee or return options
01/08/2017, 09:57:22: Rich: Yeah you should
01/08/2017, 09:57:32: Rich: Although no guarantee on a free tent isn't so bad...
01/08/2017, 10:00:26: James: Good point. @447753461116  You happy to fob off Darek's bailiff at your work until he gives up?
01/08/2017, 10:01:28: Rich: He may seek recompense in the form of office supplies!
01/08/2017, 10:03:00: James: Tell him to go sit on a rebar
01/08/2017, 10:19:28: Alex Brown: Ye he can sit on some doubled up L-bars at 150 centres
01/08/2017, 10:21:30: James: Better keep some poppers in your desk drawer...
01/08/2017, 10:24:24: James: In all seriousness, how do you want to proceed? I feel a chase coming on from Darek and we do not want to do Anny additional problemly...

01/08/2017, 17:07:15: Alex Brown: Ahh tell him he's a real cunt from me
01/08/2017, 17:07:41: Alex Brown: We can buy another on ebay and tell him to fuck off with sending more
01/08/2017, 17:07:48: Alex Brown: Atm we have a tent
01/08/2017, 17:07:54: Alex Brown: Let's check it

01/08/2017, 17:09:18: James: *you
01/08/2017, 17:09:43: Alex Brown: I'll check tonight
01/08/2017, 17:09:50: Alex Brown: According to email yes
01/08/2017, 17:09:56: Alex Brown: Bank
01/08/2017, 17:10:03: Alex Brown: Not as of yesterday
01/08/2017, 17:12:56: sil: keep the tent
01/08/2017, 17:13:11: sil: the guy is a cunt
01/08/2017, 17:13:14: Rich: I thought it was damaged?
01/08/2017, 17:13:23: Rich: I don't think he has any leverage
01/08/2017, 17:13:31: Rich: He could get eBay to blacklist you I guess
01/08/2017, 17:14:02: sil: it's his stupidness. tell him to come pick it up
01/08/2017, 17:14:19: Rich: Yeah you shouldn't have to foot the bill to send it back
01/08/2017, 17:14:36: Rich: Get him to transfer you payment for postage and then don't say it
01/08/2017, 17:14:42: Rich: Get a free tent, make a profit.
01/08/2017, 17:15:20: sil: haha
01/08/2017, 17:20:26: James: @447753461116 Once refund has been received I will email him to arrange for collection from ISIS, it's his problem. If he wants his tent he'll do it. In the meantime we need to get a new tent from decathalon. The alternative is for you to PayPal him the cost and keep his shitty possibly broken possibly missing pieces tent.
01/08/2017, 17:28:02: sil: that will scare him off. tell him he has to collect from Isis
01/08/2017, 17:28:07: sil: he won't mess around then
01/08/2017, 17:42:19: James: We still riding tonight?

01/08/2017, 17:43:38: James: To be sure to be sure to be sure
01/08/2017, 17:43:47: sil: oh you have it too

01/08/2017, 17:57:37: sil: it's fair if I slow myself down a bit
01/08/2017, 18:19:21: Alex Brown: I think atm we have a tent and should check if it's fine, if so we wait for my funds to clear and buy the item on ebay again and tell him not to deliver it
01/08/2017, 18:19:40: Alex Brown: We have tent he has money
01/08/2017, 18:20:07: Alex Brown: We don't have to fuck around with decathalon and he doesn't have to pay for recall
01/08/2017, 18:20:23: Alex Brown: I think we should put that to his ass tonight
01/08/2017, 18:20:31: Alex Brown: I'm sure he will agree
01/08/2017, 18:21:11: Alex Brown: Packaging looks fine

01/08/2017, 22:38:00: sil: yeah like .1 kg. but doesn't mean it's more compact I guess
01/08/2017, 22:38:16: Alex Brown: That's alright
01/08/2017, 23:11:21: James: It's kind of you to offer but I won't require the use of your bottom during the trip.

02/08/2017, 08:41:44: Rich: What does the article say?
02/08/2017, 08:42:11: Rich: Pfft Hummingbird can F off
02/08/2017, 08:44:43: Rich: Hmm they're doing some pretty interesting stuff
02/08/2017, 08:45:13: Rich: They claim to have presymptomatic disease detection which is the holy grail
02/08/2017, 08:45:50: Alex Brown: Nerds
02/08/2017, 08:52:48: James: Interesting
02/08/2017, 08:52:58: James: Not interesting
02/08/2017, 08:53:30: Alex Brown: Nerd

02/08/2017, 10:25:00: Alex Brown: On the concrete frame on with the retained fascade
02/08/2017, 10:25:05: James: Lord help them....
02/08/2017, 10:25:08: Alex Brown: It's not going great
02/08/2017, 10:25:25: Alex Brown: Yeh I'm now having absolutely no help
02/08/2017, 10:25:40: Alex Brown: And no one is checking the drawings but me
02/08/2017, 10:26:02: James: 😱
02/08/2017, 10:26:07: Alex Brown: And the project manager isn't doing shit
02/08/2017, 10:26:17: Alex Brown: So I'm having to do that too
02/08/2017, 10:27:46: Alex Brown: *design coordinator
02/08/2017, 10:27:55: Alex Brown: Or what ever you call them

02/08/2017, 10:28:49: James: Principal Designer?
02/08/2017, 10:29:40: Alex Brown: Who ever organises the design subcontractors
02/08/2017, 10:30:29: James: In terms of CDM?
02/08/2017, 10:30:56: James: Or in terms of general project management?
02/08/2017, 10:31:27: Rich: Could you make a note of all the buildings that are constructed in this way?
02/08/2017, 10:31:39: Rich: I want to ensure I avoid going within 100m of any of them
02/08/2017, 10:32:02: sil: please cc me in on that note too
02/08/2017, 10:35:28: James: NB: If you exceed your remit you may void your firm's professional indemnity insurance...
02/08/2017, 10:37:20: James: Sounds like that policy either is, or will, be taking quite a battering so you probably don't want to piss them off.....
02/08/2017, 11:06:06: Rich: Still no nos...
02/08/2017, 11:06:25: sil: eBay.....
02/08/2017, 11:06:39: Rich: Was that eBay too?

02/08/2017, 12:40:43: Rich: Still no nos
02/08/2017, 12:40:50: Rich: Maybe it got intercepted :O
02/08/2017, 12:43:33: sil: but what about our bake sale :(
02/08/2017, 12:45:36: Rich: I guess our cream will go unwhipped
02/08/2017, 12:47:26: sil: what's the tracking number?
and who is the carrier?
02/08/2017, 13:02:28: Alex Brown: Dunno
02/08/2017, 13:02:33: Alex Brown: Links broken
02/08/2017, 13:02:40: James: 999 / MI5
02/08/2017, 13:03:18: James: Ring them Alex - they're sure to be keen to help
02/08/2017, 13:23:14: James: Maybe it's a Lock Stock type scam - where they screw you over and the customer is too embarrassed to seek redress via official channels...
02/08/2017, 13:25:13: sil: your girlfriend likes baking
02/08/2017, 13:25:32: sil: you thought you'd buy her some whipped cream canisters for her as a present
02/08/2017, 13:25:48: sil: you didn't realise there was any other use for them
02/08/2017, 13:26:35: sil: stick to that story.
although you've already made it looks suspicious by ordering to someone else's house.....
02/08/2017, 13:26:47: sil: sorry alex. looks like your going down
02/08/2017, 13:27:47: sil: if you ordered to your own house you have pleaded ignorance. let that be a lesson for you.
02/08/2017, 13:27:58: James: Don't worry Alex- you'll get plenty of cream in prison 😉
02/08/2017, 13:28:51: Rich: At least the poppers arrived
02/08/2017, 13:29:25: sil: you should also be able to have a bike ride in prison.
but you may have to be the bike
02/08/2017, 13:29:29: James: And you won't have to order to someone else's house either - I understand it will be delivered via the back door
02/08/2017, 13:29:39: James: Lol
02/08/2017, 13:31:25: sil: I bet police have intercepted the package and are now looking into the order details.
as soon as the realise the eBay account details and the residents address don't match they will be suspicious
02/08/2017, 13:31:52: sil: rich will be very smug when you go to prison
02/08/2017, 13:32:27: James: Although they may consider the two to have conspired together...
02/08/2017, 13:33:21: James: Maybe they'll let you stay in the same cell?
02/08/2017, 13:33:30: sil: well the package is under Alex's name.
ordered from his account.
I mean they might determine that Alex is dealing to rich. but either way Alex is going down for a long long time
02/08/2017, 13:33:57: sil: I hear nos offences are up to 30 years
02/08/2017, 13:34:03: Alex Brown: En route niggaz
02/08/2017, 13:34:11: sil: the police?
02/08/2017, 13:34:19: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:34:48: James: Very racist Alex. A police constable is a police constable regardless of race.
02/08/2017, 13:34:54: James: Shame on you.
02/08/2017, 13:34:55: sil: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:35:17: Alex Brown: Oooh dear

02/08/2017, 13:36:01: James: Yeah Hermes Unit is code name for the drugs squad
02/08/2017, 13:36:31: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:36:33: Alex Brown: 24 in each box
02/08/2017, 13:36:46: Alex Brown: 24 each or 12 doublea
02/08/2017, 13:36:58: Alex Brown: Rich
02/08/2017, 13:37:15: Alex Brown: You might have to stay in your pants for another day
02/08/2017, 13:38:35: Alex Brown: Same twats that broke my boat
02/08/2017, 13:39:32: Rich: Lucky for your I'm staying home another day to receive my new mac
02/08/2017, 13:41:04: Rich: 12 doubles each should last about 2 hours
02/08/2017, 13:42:24: sil: we could be sensible and have singles
02/08/2017, 13:43:01: sil: how about 1 double a day
02/08/2017, 13:43:06: sil: the rest singles
02/08/2017, 13:43:24: Rich: Well it's two nights
02/08/2017, 13:43:26: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:43:30: Rich: So 6 doubles a night
02/08/2017, 13:43:38: sil: how singles, but we poor poppers into the balloons
02/08/2017, 13:43:44: Alex Brown: Yeh
02/08/2017, 13:43:53: Rich: That sounds dangerous
02/08/2017, 13:43:55: Alex Brown: I agree with sil
02/08/2017, 13:44:12: Rich: I don't want chemical burns in my throat
02/08/2017, 13:44:12: sil: then were balling
02/08/2017, 13:44:19: Alex Brown: Not with the drinking of poppers
02/08/2017, 13:44:35: sil: the poppers would probs melt the balloon
02/08/2017, 13:44:52: Rich: Yeah possibly
02/08/2017, 13:45:00: Rich: They'd definitely melt your throat
02/08/2017, 13:47:02: Alex Brown: Wish I'd waited for that speed
02/08/2017, 13:47:12: Alex Brown: Sil bring the morphine
02/08/2017, 13:47:28: Alex Brown: Let's go for a clean legal binge
02/08/2017, 13:48:07: Rich: Maybe if you mix poppers, nos and morphine in just the right way you'll be able to simulate weed
02/08/2017, 13:48:22: Alex Brown: Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
02/08/2017, 13:48:27: Alex Brown: Icky
02/08/2017, 13:48:35: James: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:49:15: Rich: Fortunately I'm not paying for it :)
02/08/2017, 13:49:27: James: Sweet.
02/08/2017, 13:49:42: James: You can bin it guilt free then.
02/08/2017, 13:49:57: James: 😝
02/08/2017, 13:50:48: Rich: I wouldn't want to waste a pentium i7 quad core, 16gb of ram and a 512GB PCIe SSD
02/08/2017, 13:51:08: Rich: Nor a super high res Retina display
02/08/2017, 13:51:49: James: <‎image omitted>
02/08/2017, 13:52:37: Alex Brown: Nerd
02/08/2017, 14:02:40: sil: this guy is right
02/08/2017, 14:03:10: Rich: I think I'd feel pretty guilty actually
02/08/2017, 14:03:21: sil: you should already
02/08/2017, 14:03:36: Rich: It's better than your computer
02/08/2017, 14:03:41: Rich: Because your computer doesn't exist
02/08/2017, 14:03:46: sil: I don't have a computer
02/08/2017, 14:03:49: Rich: Or are you going to borrow daddy's computer
02/08/2017, 14:04:40: sil: not having a computer is actually very cool rich
02/08/2017, 14:04:52: sil: it's anti conformist
02/08/2017, 14:06:06: sil: I like to live in the REAL world
02/08/2017, 14:06:43: Rich: He says to his phone using a virtual keyboard
02/08/2017, 14:07:07: sil: I'm actually dictating this with my voice
02/08/2017, 14:07:16: sil: I don't ever look at my phone
02/08/2017, 14:07:30: Rich: I'm sure your colleagues love that
02/08/2017, 14:07:57: sil: yes they do. they like hearing me say these things loudly
02/08/2017, 14:09:23: Rich: How do you do the caps?
02/08/2017, 14:10:28: sil: it's an android. it's a very good phone. it just knows
02/08/2017, 14:13:58: Rich: Yeah it knows everything doesn't it?
02/08/2017, 14:14:16: sil: yeah it does
02/08/2017, 14:14:17: Rich: As do the people that have installed rootware on it
02/08/2017, 14:15:07: sil: I'm yet to have a virus or know anyone who has
02/08/2017, 14:15:26: sil: Fortunately the virus scam software is free!
02/08/2017, 14:16:01: James: Very generous!
02/08/2017, 14:16:09: Rich: There's nothing like the animation of a shield slowly filling with colour as different bits of technical sounding text are displayed on the screen to make you feel safe
02/08/2017, 14:16:43: sil: rich has been reading fake news on iPhone bum boy blogs
02/08/2017, 14:22:37: James: Only joking about the binning, obviously don't do that - it would contaminate the established waste streams and that would be unethical. Best you have a specialist carrier take it an abandoned mine where it can be encased in lead and buried. That way it won't be able to harm anyone else 🙂
02/08/2017, 14:22:55: James: Simples.
02/08/2017, 14:24:12: sil: great idea James
02/08/2017, 15:26:32: Alex Brown: i agree wholeheartedly with james's sentiments

02/08/2017, 17:11:02: sil: oh Alex needs a travel tampon holder for his bike
02/08/2017, 17:11:16: sil: he's pretty embarrassed so didn't wanna say himself

02/08/2017, 21:34:35: Rich: Is it that important?
02/08/2017, 21:36:09: James: Alex is deflating his tyres tonight to install liners
02/08/2017, 21:36:24: James: Need to get them back to 65 psi

03/08/2017, 08:35:45: James: Looked a bit lumpy
03/08/2017, 08:39:11: Rich: ...
03/08/2017, 08:45:50: Alex Brown: Front wheel is a ok
03/08/2017, 08:45:51: Alex Brown: Back wheel was lumpy te fook
03/08/2017, 08:45:52: Alex Brown: And needs repumping easy
03/08/2017, 08:45:52: Alex Brown: James is just throwing spanners into the works
03/08/2017, 08:45:52: Alex Brown: Naughty naughty james
03/08/2017, 08:45:58: Alex Brown: My bike is superior in style speed and ruggedness now
03/08/2017, 08:46:44: Rich: The only way it could be superior in speed is if you're not riding it
03/08/2017, 08:47:21: James: Front tire was flat. Did you replace inner tube?
03/08/2017, 08:47:43: James: 🔧🔧🔧🔧🔧
03/08/2017, 08:50:59: Alex Brown: CUTE

03/08/2017, 08:51:52: James: Balls.
03/08/2017, 08:51:52: Alex Brown: I just thought it was flat
03/08/2017, 08:51:53: Alex Brown: I was wrong
03/08/2017, 08:51:53: Alex Brown: Bike felt slow

03/08/2017, 08:52:18: Alex Brown: Super
03/08/2017, 08:52:18: Alex Brown: Fast
03/08/2017, 08:53:12: Rich: The only time you're super fast is going down hill in a universe where kinetic and potential mass aren't equivalent!

03/08/2017, 08:55:27: Rich: I think you're having us on
03/08/2017, 08:57:25: James: Front tube needs changing which includes refitting tire liner. Back tube was pinched hence tire lumpy. Both tubes need pumping to 65psi by someone with a gauge.
03/08/2017, 08:58:21: sil: I don't think James is having us on
03/08/2017, 08:58:23: Alex Brown: I bent my ankle a bit this morning

03/08/2017, 08:59:28: Rich: I say 9:30
03/08/2017, 08:59:29: sil: as in the time we will be leaving with or without Alex
03/08/2017, 08:59:33: sil: ok deal
03/08/2017, 08:59:35: sil: locked in
03/08/2017, 08:59:40: Rich: Good

03/08/2017, 09:01:08: Rich: No one is to drink on Friday until their bike and equipment is completely ready
03/08/2017, 09:03:07: Alex Brown: Good luck with that
03/08/2017, 09:03:40: sil: not even Nicola or his mother can stop Alex drinking
03/08/2017, 09:03:49: sil: I don't think you have much chance rich
03/08/2017, 09:04:12: sil: you can send him to his room
03/08/2017, 09:37:05: Alex Brown: Yeh rich send me to my room with a hip flask of whiskey and 3litres of gin and tonic in a camelbak
03/08/2017, 09:37:15: Alex Brown: You'd probably find me dead
03/08/2017, 09:42:09: sil: erg that'd be so annoying, and just like you if you died before the bike trip.
would be such a hassle and a time drain to drag your fat ass out into the street so you don't start rotting on richs rug
03/08/2017, 09:42:35: sil: would delay our start time by a good half hour. selfish

03/08/2017, 09:54:43: James: I'd be up for an earlier start on Saturday to try and get a big push done whilst we're dry and in tiptop condition/ bikes intact etc.?
03/08/2017, 09:56:09: sil: erg. looks pretty dire on sat.
how about we reschedule the bike trip. let's do it next month instead
03/08/2017, 09:56:36: sil: jokes. nah we will do it
03/08/2017, 09:58:13: sil: hopefully it stops raining by the time we have to set up camp. that's the most annoying part
03/08/2017, 09:58:16: Rich: The funny thing is that the weather was glorious in early spring
03/08/2017, 09:58:19: Rich: Yeah
03/08/2017, 09:58:31: Rich: It's doesn't matter too
Much if we have to cycle
In the rain
03/08/2017, 09:59:08: Rich: Haha it just changed to lightning on Saturday in Walthamstow
03/08/2017, 09:59:12: Rich: 🌩

03/08/2017, 12:03:39: James: Lol
03/08/2017, 12:03:55: James: Third world problems
03/08/2017, 12:23:15: sil: rich open the package
03/08/2017, 12:23:20: sil: show us the metal
03/08/2017, 12:23:54: sil: this is when we realise it's just c02
03/08/2017, 12:23:55: Rich: You'd like that wouldn't you? ;)
03/08/2017, 12:24:22: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:24:45: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:25:08: sil: the anticipation

03/08/2017, 12:25:33: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:25:50: sil: weird
03/08/2017, 12:26:03: sil: it's not c02 is it?
03/08/2017, 12:26:24: sil: is it nos?
03/08/2017, 12:26:54: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:27:01: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:27:06: sil: I guess there are some loose cause we ordered 100 and they are boxes of 24
03/08/2017, 12:27:24: Rich: Yeah it's 4 spare
03/08/2017, 12:27:29: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:27:39: sil: nice.
we can have those 4 Friday night
03/08/2017, 12:28:05: Rich: Ha yeah I guess so
03/08/2017, 12:29:16: Rich: Each charger whips half a litre of cream
03/08/2017, 12:29:38: Rich: We could make 50 litres of cream into whipped cream
03/08/2017, 12:29:44: Rich: That's enough to fill a bath
03/08/2017, 12:32:23: sil: let's just live off of whipped cream
03/08/2017, 12:34:15: Rich: I bought a huge tub of reduced whipping cream and ate it across a few days at uni
03/08/2017, 12:34:30: Rich: That was when I first got stabby arse pain
03/08/2017, 12:34:33: Rich: Never again
03/08/2017, 12:34:38: sil: ew
03/08/2017, 12:35:13: sil: I thought the first time you got stabby arse pain was camping with Alex
03/08/2017, 12:35:23: Rich: ...
03/08/2017, 12:35:31: Rich: One of the spares is broken
03/08/2017, 12:35:39: Rich: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:36:02: sil: thats a shame. probably a manufacturing error
03/08/2017, 12:36:08: Rich: I guess we can just discharge 3 and fill 4 balloons
03/08/2017, 12:36:10: Rich: Yeah
03/08/2017, 12:36:35: sil: discharge 3!?
that's no where near a double
03/08/2017, 12:38:39: Rich: Each will be 3 8ths of a double
03/08/2017, 12:39:10: Rich: Or we could make a triple and force alex to take it so we can slip him a Valium whilst he's tripping
03/08/2017, 12:41:44: sil: i don't think you need to "slip" Alex drugs
03/08/2017, 12:41:54: sil: just ask him if he would like to take some drugs
03/08/2017, 12:52:13: James: <‎image omitted>
03/08/2017, 12:54:48: James: I think they're protesting about an exceptionally poor quality broadcast of something called Killer Women...
03/08/2017, 12:55:11: Rich: Right...
03/08/2017, 12:55:26: James: I further understand that only blood will satisfy this mob...
03/08/2017, 12:55:31: Rich: I made the silly assumption that it was about the NHS
03/08/2017, 12:55:51: James: Sounds serious in any case
03/08/2017, 12:56:37: James: Seems to be a mixed-bag multi-purpose event
03/08/2017, 12:59:42: sil: I actually did deliver a copy of Killer women with some corruption on the file to some territories in Europe.
but I believe I resupplied before transmission
03/08/2017, 13:01:13: sil: corruption caused by being copied over to a fucking mac
03/08/2017, 13:03:51: James: Fucks sake...
03/08/2017, 13:04:02: James: Nice one Rich
03/08/2017, 13:04:40: sil: thanks rich. for supporting a shit brand. let it die.
03/08/2017, 13:12:41: Alex Brown: £35/4 = bevs for me
03/08/2017, 13:14:05: sil: I don't understand
03/08/2017, 13:14:19: sil: what is that calculation?
03/08/2017, 13:17:59: James: The antonym of generous.
03/08/2017, 13:18:38: sil: that's strange. when I do that sum I get 8.75. think you made an error Alex
03/08/2017, 13:20:32: Alex Brown: 2 bevs min
03/08/2017, 13:20:37: Alex Brown: Each
03/08/2017, 13:20:59: sil: oh right. your asking for reimbursement for the nos?
03/08/2017, 13:21:13: Alex Brown: We've done a complete round
03/08/2017, 13:21:26: sil: haha oh no. Alex I'm not going to pay for it. I don't want it. I'm just gonna have it because it's there
03/08/2017, 13:21:40: sil: awful drug really. but if I must do loads if double I will
03/08/2017, 13:22:03: sil: for the good of the group
03/08/2017, 13:22:13: Alex Brown: Lol rich
03/08/2017, 13:25:54: Rich: Actually alex my time is worth £40 an hour
03/08/2017, 13:26:14: Rich: And I've spent 21 hours waiting for the nos
03/08/2017, 13:26:38: Rich: You owe me around 200 pints
03/08/2017, 13:28:03: sil: I hate dirty balloons. so tempting to do loads when you buy them. it's not fair really
03/08/2017, 13:28:06: Alex Brown: Oh and has your lame book arrived yet rich?
03/08/2017, 13:28:53: James: I'm happy to provide the dispenser but will have to charge  £2.92 per day to cover my costs. Therefore we're even.
03/08/2017, 13:28:58: Alex Brown: I don't think you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that working at home has slowed down your work
03/08/2017, 13:29:41: Alex Brown: James obviously pays less as I owe him about 4 quid after yesterday's pints
03/08/2017, 13:29:41: James: It is not possible to slow that which is stationary.
03/08/2017, 13:30:00: Alex Brown: And he is providing equipment
03/08/2017, 13:30:10: Alex Brown: Therefore he pays zero
03/08/2017, 13:30:24: Alex Brown: Sil and rich foot his bill
03/08/2017, 13:30:30: James: Nice.
03/08/2017, 13:30:37: James: Cheers lads.
03/08/2017, 13:30:48: James: Most kind.
03/08/2017, 13:30:58: Alex Brown: 10 quid each please guys
03/08/2017, 13:31:08: sil: nope
03/08/2017, 13:31:24: Rich: I'm calling the police
03/08/2017, 13:31:32: Alex Brown: Poppers are 15 for 5 bottles
03/08/2017, 13:31:58: Alex Brown: Oh hi police there are illegal drugs in my house
03/08/2017, 13:32:11: sil: with your name on the package
03/08/2017, 13:32:45: Alex Brown: Please just take that package and not search my drawers for disgusting buds
03/08/2017, 13:33:48: Alex Brown: Rich your appetite for filth knows no bounds
03/08/2017, 13:34:19: sil: ok Alex. I'll make you a deal. I'm not going to pay you any money, and I will huff a whole box but I'll pay you in friendship
03/08/2017, 13:34:31: Alex Brown: Hmmm
03/08/2017, 13:34:32: Alex Brown: No
03/08/2017, 13:35:03: sil: hmm I don't want to pay you money. that's very capitalist
03/08/2017, 13:35:05: Rich: You ordered them and you are trying to charge us
03/08/2017, 13:35:18: sil: very true
03/08/2017, 13:35:30: sil: we didn't hear about this charge pre order
03/08/2017, 13:35:35: Rich: It's not illegal to possess nos but it is illegal to sell it to people with the expressed into to consume it
03/08/2017, 13:35:39: sil: there was no agreement
03/08/2017, 13:35:40: Rich: No I didn't
03/08/2017, 13:35:53: Rich: When alex was asking me to stay at home and wait for his package
03/08/2017, 13:36:07: Alex Brown: Only dicks would take drugs and not pay their friends
03/08/2017, 13:36:25: sil: dick is a nickname for rich
03/08/2017, 13:36:35: Rich: Only dicks would charge their friends without being upfront about it
03/08/2017, 13:36:56: Rich: I definitely wouldn't have waited at home for you if I knew you were going to oblige me to pay for it
03/08/2017, 13:37:12: Rich: Maybe I'll withhold them until you apologise
03/08/2017, 13:37:40: sil: when you think about it alex. your actually the one in the wrong here
03/08/2017, 13:37:51: Rich: Yeah
03/08/2017, 13:38:28: sil: apologise to me too for putting temptation in my way for a cost
03/08/2017, 13:38:43: sil: you pusher
03/08/2017, 13:39:18: Alex Brown: I think you Mr silverwood found richs address on facebook
03/08/2017, 13:39:36: Alex Brown: And pushed me to deliver these items to his house
03/08/2017, 13:39:51: sil: that was the poppers
03/08/2017, 13:40:02: Alex Brown: You are the king pin in this operation
03/08/2017, 13:40:19: Rich: Sil isn't trying to charge me money
03/08/2017, 13:40:40: Alex Brown: The poppers were a joke because I felt bad about going against richs word
03/08/2017, 13:40:52: sil: I thought poppers to richs house was funny
03/08/2017, 13:41:10: Alex Brown: And you were yet again the one that pushed me to order nos last friday
03/08/2017, 13:42:05: sil: I'M FEELING ATTACKED!!
03/08/2017, 13:42:46: Rich: None of this is at all pertinent to whether we should pay you
03/08/2017, 13:43:13: Alex Brown: You will pay me back if you use my property
03/08/2017, 13:43:19: Alex Brown: The question is when
03/08/2017, 13:43:24: Rich: Well it's in my possession
03/08/2017, 13:43:44: Rich: And you're not getting it until you sincerely apologise for this insurrection
03/08/2017, 13:43:44: sil: yes. the law would see the drugs as a gift to rich
03/08/2017, 13:43:45: Alex Brown: Possession is 9/10ths of the law
03/08/2017, 13:44:09: Alex Brown: And the law also say you are in possession of drugs
03/08/2017, 13:44:19: Alex Brown: With intent to get high
03/08/2017, 13:44:28: Rich: I have no nefarious intent here
03/08/2017, 13:44:39: Rich: Also that's not Illegal
03/08/2017, 13:44:45: Alex Brown: I think you do rich
03/08/2017, 13:44:49: Rich: It's only illegal to sell them
03/08/2017, 13:44:56: Rich: Which is what you're trying to do
03/08/2017, 13:45:01: Rich: And frankly failing at
03/08/2017, 13:45:14: Alex Brown: Give me my money or I'll break your bike
03/08/2017, 13:45:21: Alex Brown: I've done it before
03/08/2017, 13:45:26: Alex Brown: I'll do it again

03/08/2017, 13:50:25: sil: this is why were not paying you alex. a lifetime of financial transactions have obviously made you spoilt and entitled. you don't realise the value of giving your friends drugs for free
03/08/2017, 13:50:44: sil: we're trying to give you the gift of that feeling. accept it from us
03/08/2017, 13:52:39: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>

03/08/2017, 13:56:12: Rich: Right I've sent it all to the police as evidence
03/08/2017, 13:56:17: Rich: He won't get away with it this time
03/08/2017, 13:57:31: sil: oh good Lord. your being very aggressive now!

03/08/2017, 18:32:59: James: With that attitude it's practically guaranteed.
03/08/2017, 18:33:51: James: Hope everyone has arranged waterproofs?!
03/08/2017, 18:34:04: Alex Brown: Weather reports are for pussies

03/08/2017, 19:06:26: sil: Alex you keep looking at London central. not accurate weather
03/08/2017, 19:07:59: Rich: Wasn't the last one you checked for Colchester?
03/08/2017, 19:08:08: Rich: I think the worst of the weather is further east at the moment
03/08/2017, 19:08:25: sil: last one was the chelmsford
03/08/2017, 19:08:35: sil: one before that was colchester
03/08/2017, 19:08:40: Rich: .

03/08/2017, 19:09:08: Rich: I reckon we might be alright
03/08/2017, 19:09:33: Rich: Chelmsford is halfway between London and Colchester
03/08/2017, 19:09:40: Rich: Dunno how big an impact that has on the weather
03/08/2017, 19:09:53: Rich: As long as there isn't lightning it'll be fine
03/08/2017, 19:11:39: sil: basically it looks like sat will be the shitest day and then itl be fine
03/08/2017, 19:19:57: James: 🐈

03/08/2017, 19:40:40: James: Less problemy
03/08/2017, 19:50:15: sil: have you packed your nos?

04/08/2017, 13:55:57: Rich: Hitler hates smoking but anything else goes
04/08/2017, 13:56:24: sil: basically the book highlights the smoking thing to outline is delusion and hypocrisy
04/08/2017, 13:56:32: sil: he never thought of himself as taking drugs
04/08/2017, 13:56:47: sil: he had a personal doctor who used to give him "medical shots"
04/08/2017, 13:57:42: sil: he also hated casual drug use and tried to ban the rampant amphetamine drug use in wartime Germany
04/08/2017, 13:58:01: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
04/08/2017, 13:58:06: Rich: I thought the German army was on amphetimines?
04/08/2017, 13:58:28: sil: at the same time his doctor was giving him shots of testosterone and steroids
04/08/2017, 13:58:31: sil: they were
04/08/2017, 13:58:39: sil: buy again. not "casual"
04/08/2017, 13:58:48: Rich: It's fine as long as you're working
04/08/2017, 13:59:56: sil: yeah. Hitler was a complicated man. with a super ego that justified anything he did as right no matter if it split further held beliefs and made no logical sense
04/08/2017, 14:00:40: Rich: Sounds like Anne rand
04/08/2017, 14:00:57: sil: could even say like Donald trump
04/08/2017, 14:01:20: Rich: Mmm
04/08/2017, 14:02:21: sil: you could imagine trump on one hand saying something is bad and on another doing that thing himself, but have  a firm held conviction  why it isn't the same thing as the thing he condemned
04/08/2017, 14:03:06: Rich: Yeah some people are good at hypocrisy
04/08/2017, 14:03:23: Rich: Although I think the Donald is actually totally sober
04/08/2017, 14:03:28: Rich: Like he doesn't even drink
04/08/2017, 14:03:34: Rich: You can't trust a man that doesn't drink
04/08/2017, 14:04:27: sil: yeah he is

08/08/2017, 15:23:07: Alex Brown: Ya sounds good

08/08/2017, 15:27:02: sil: richs house is like a borrowers den
08/08/2017, 15:27:14: sil: except rich only just under average height
08/08/2017, 15:27:58: James: I'm away this weekend and next but could do Fri 25th - Sun 27th August floor Cambridge?
08/08/2017, 15:28:37: Rich: I've got to attend some lame engagement party that weekend
08/08/2017, 15:28:58: sil: yes
08/08/2017, 15:48:08: James: No worries. The first 3 weeks of September are currently clear, although I may be in dam for one of those...
08/08/2017, 18:23:05: Alex Brown: mon 28th is bank holiday
08/08/2017, 18:23:18: Alex Brown: im at a wedding on the sat I think

08/08/2017, 18:26:02: sil: is that the one Adam and Kirsty are going to?
08/08/2017, 18:26:07: Alex Brown: it a different date

08/08/2017, 18:26:28: sil: thought Adam didn't do weddings?
hmm
08/08/2017, 18:27:40: sil: I just don't understand how Nicola goes to so many weddings
08/08/2017, 18:28:32: sil: it doesn't make sense. is it like the same friends getting married, getting divorced and then getting married again?
08/08/2017, 18:58:22: Alex Brown: No she's female
08/08/2017, 18:58:40: Alex Brown: Girls generally marry earlier than men
08/08/2017, 18:59:49: Alex Brown: To generalise to the max
08/08/2017, 19:51:09: Rich: Look Alex! This meme is about you

08/08/2017, 21:09:50: Rich: Lol
09/08/2017, 08:29:29: James: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 08:30:35: Rich: Only £23!
09/08/2017, 08:30:43: James: You could use two shakeweights at the same time
09/08/2017, 08:42:02: James: Pound for pound that's a real bargain!
09/08/2017, 10:42:32: sil: would anyone like to place a bet on the start date for war between  America and north Korea?
09/08/2017, 10:44:46: sil: there won't be much of a prize however
09/08/2017, 10:46:49: Rich: I think it's just rhetoric
09/08/2017, 10:47:52: sil: I hope so. until trump refuses to back down and orders something silly
09/08/2017, 10:48:40: Rich: Yeah that's the concern. But he is surrounded by generals and they're likely to be very cautious
09/08/2017, 10:51:00: James: That Donald guy's got this one all jong. Some one should kick kim in t'rump.

09/08/2017, 13:21:56: sil: mine too bro
09/08/2017, 13:27:17: James: This is work Alex. It's a tough job but someone has to do it.
09/08/2017, 13:28:11: Alex Brown: Awful
09/08/2017, 13:28:51: Alex Brown: My test results came back
09/08/2017, 13:29:02: Alex Brown: I'm not dying of cancer
09/08/2017, 13:29:08: sil: did they say you need to do more drugs?
09/08/2017, 13:29:13: Alex Brown: But I do have a nasal polypse
09/08/2017, 13:29:29: Alex Brown: From sniffing lots of md In 2013
09/08/2017, 13:29:35: James: What's that?
09/08/2017, 13:29:44: sil: yeah what is?
09/08/2017, 13:29:59: Alex Brown: It's those things that kill people's sense of smell
09/08/2017, 13:30:09: Alex Brown: A harmless pile of the nose
09/08/2017, 13:30:22: Alex Brown: Makes u snore and blocks your nose
09/08/2017, 13:30:47: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 13:31:10: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 13:31:34: Alex Brown: Second one
09/08/2017, 13:32:19: James: Drug sensitivity?
09/08/2017, 13:33:21: sil: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 13:33:57: sil: or aids
09/08/2017, 13:35:27: Alex Brown: I don't have aids
09/08/2017, 13:35:57: James: Did the doctor say that?
09/08/2017, 13:36:17: Alex Brown: My blood is negative for aids
09/08/2017, 13:36:26: sil: that's a relief for rich. you touched his dick. he was nervous.
09/08/2017, 13:36:30: Alex Brown: I had a test as apart of the headaches
09/08/2017, 13:37:15: Alex Brown: The only aids I have are the ones that drive me places
09/08/2017, 13:39:58: Alex Brown: No but I know
09/08/2017, 13:40:21: sil: to an early grave?
09/08/2017, 13:43:33: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 13:43:37: Alex Brown: Aids
09/08/2017, 13:48:09: James: Interesting. The first ever recorded case. You should contact a medical journal and offer to be studied.
09/08/2017, 13:50:14: Rich: Is it causing headaches by increasing sinus pressure?
09/08/2017, 13:50:41: Rich: You must be kidneying
09/08/2017, 13:50:55: James: Lol
09/08/2017, 13:53:12: Alex Brown: Dunno
09/08/2017, 13:53:23: Alex Brown: Don't have sinus pressure
09/08/2017, 13:53:35: Rich: So what's causing the headaches?
09/08/2017, 13:53:47: Rich: Are you gonna have to quit the gin!?
09/08/2017, 13:53:47: Alex Brown: And the poor man's temp doctor said it's nothing to do with headaches
09/08/2017, 13:53:50: Alex Brown: Dunno
09/08/2017, 13:53:54: Alex Brown: Stress?
09/08/2017, 13:54:01: Alex Brown: No idea
09/08/2017, 13:54:06: Rich: Omg you'll have to quit gin!
09/08/2017, 13:54:14: Alex Brown: Let the doctors decide
09/08/2017, 13:54:21: Rich: Maybe you should try just to see if that is what's causing it
09/08/2017, 13:54:53: Alex Brown: Mari at work said her sister had awful headache and found out it was a histamine allergy
09/08/2017, 13:54:59: Alex Brown: Cause by drinking
09/08/2017, 13:55:06: Alex Brown: That would be horrific
09/08/2017, 13:55:12: James: Elimination diet sounds sensible
09/08/2017, 13:55:31: Alex Brown: If that includes alcohol
09/08/2017, 13:55:35: Alex Brown: No way
09/08/2017, 13:55:44: Alex Brown: I use it to breathe
09/08/2017, 13:55:59: sil: maybe it's a severe cat allergy
09/08/2017, 13:56:12: Alex Brown: I'm not allergic to animals
09/08/2017, 13:56:18: sil: sorry james. you might have to get rid of mishka
09/08/2017, 13:56:31: James: Not happening.
09/08/2017, 13:56:49: sil: sorry James, you might have to get rid of Alex
09/08/2017, 13:57:04: James: No problem
09/08/2017, 13:57:09: James: 😜
09/08/2017, 13:57:12: Alex Brown: Human life is superior to cat life
09/08/2017, 13:57:24: Alex Brown: Cats can't design buildings
09/08/2017, 13:57:48: sil: to be fair. if the cat has caused this infliction to alex. it's is only just and fair to put her down
09/08/2017, 13:59:54: James: 😾
09/08/2017, 14:00:57: sil: true
09/08/2017, 14:01:15: Rich: Cats can't endanger human life by designing buildings badly
09/08/2017, 14:02:07: sil: not true. if a cat didn't happen to design a building. and somehow it got approved. that building would be a death trap
09/08/2017, 14:02:14: James: Neither can you. Which means you must be a cat. Which means you are Alex's most likely allergen. Which means you must be put down.
09/08/2017, 14:02:15: sil: did*
09/08/2017, 14:02:28: Rich: That's true
09/08/2017, 14:02:46: Rich: But it still requires someone like alex to not realise a cat has done the design and approve it
09/08/2017, 14:03:26: sil: not if the person who approves the plan is also a cat
09/08/2017, 14:04:07: Rich: Hmm
09/08/2017, 14:06:22: sil: <‎image omitted>
09/08/2017, 14:27:30: Rich: Train tickets were £47 each
09/08/2017, 14:27:47: Rich: I owe alex £75 and both james and sil £20 (I think)
09/08/2017, 14:28:04: sil: you owe me 20?
09/08/2017, 14:28:09: Rich: So £27 owed to me by sil and james
09/08/2017, 14:28:19: Rich: I thought you bought a round for
Me?
09/08/2017, 14:28:30: sil: oh I thought u meant post tickets
09/08/2017, 14:28:31: Rich: And I still owe alex £28
09/08/2017, 14:28:34: sil: yeah sure
09/08/2017, 14:28:48: Rich: Can you pay alex james?
09/08/2017, 14:28:53: Rich: Cool
09/08/2017, 14:29:02: Rich: Do you have my deets sil?
09/08/2017, 14:30:05: sil: I do. I will use my banking app
09/08/2017, 14:31:02: sil: done. so simple when you use technology
09/08/2017, 14:31:22: sil: you should try getting into apps rich
09/08/2017, 14:31:23: Rich: Great cheers
09/08/2017, 14:31:33: Rich: Yeah I will as soon as I unlock my card...
09/08/2017, 14:31:41: Rich: For online banking
09/08/2017, 14:33:27: James: @447753461116 Can you send me bank details and amount(s) owed please? Also do we still need to pay Darek?
09/08/2017, 15:11:41: sil: I'm literally covered in bites from that woods
09/08/2017, 15:17:11: Rich: Same
09/08/2017, 15:17:36: Rich: I think if you pay alex £27 james then I'm square with everyone

14/08/2017, 19:10:18: sil: unless his mommy can cover him up in cotton wool and kiss him better at the bottom of every hill
14/08/2017, 19:12:41: Alex Brown: V dangerous

14/08/2017, 20:54:10: Alex Brown: Badly
14/08/2017, 20:55:39: sil: get on with it then
14/08/2017, 20:56:54: Alex Brown: Too hot and tired
14/08/2017, 20:57:05: Alex Brown: Got 2 more days
14/08/2017, 20:57:19: James: Did you do any practice?
15/08/2017, 08:57:41: sil: I've got my bike ready in my carv
15/08/2017, 08:58:35: sil: just realised I don't have proper mountain bike tyres. but i guess it's not gonna be super muddy or anything so should still keep grip
15/08/2017, 09:04:52: James: There's a variety - a skills area road course, gravel and trails. Fun for all lol
15/08/2017, 09:05:57: James: It's been fairly dry I think so should be ok. The track will be maintained really well so should be fine.
15/08/2017, 09:07:39: James: <‎image omitted>
15/08/2017, 09:08:51: sil: looks fun. I'm sure we will get shower up by a bunch of pros

15/08/2017, 09:37:59: sil: when you pay for a session do you get access to everything?
15/08/2017, 09:38:52: sil: oh nice the trails are graded from easy to hard.
15/08/2017, 09:38:56: James: I presume so. I haven't seen any other costs mentioned on the website.
15/08/2017, 09:39:08: James: Blue/red/black
15/08/2017, 09:39:50: sil: guess we can give the blue a go and then try the red if we feel brave enough. then cool down with a road loop
15/08/2017, 09:40:01: James: I thought we'd start on a short blue to warm up and then try the red? I can't do black.
15/08/2017, 09:40:13: James: Hah snap
15/08/2017, 09:40:40: James: Reds are weird - some trails are easy, some are mental.
15/08/2017, 09:40:42: sil: nah I can't do black.
I mean obviously I can because I'm hench, but I have a cold/headache/achy leg
15/08/2017, 09:41:32: James: I guess red covers a fairly wide range of just harder than blue and just easier than black in places
15/08/2017, 09:41:43: James: @447753461116 You coming tonight?
15/08/2017, 09:50:25: sil: yeah Alex come. we will do the easy ones and road course

15/08/2017, 16:21:24: sil: Alex is making excuses. he's scared of mountain biking
15/08/2017, 16:21:36: sil: Alex breaks down hills
15/08/2017, 16:22:32: James: Then why have a 🚵🏻‍♀ at all?
15/08/2017, 16:28:23: sil: it's a pretty good opportunity to keep fitness up after our big bike ride
15/08/2017, 17:44:20: sil: leaving work at 6.

15/08/2017, 20:46:54: sil: your a tax drain on the NHS tho
15/08/2017, 20:47:09: sil: I never go to the doctor cus I don't sponge off our beloved NHS

15/08/2017, 20:48:34: Alex Brown: With MY taxes
15/08/2017, 20:48:50: Alex Brown: It would b stupid not to get your money's worth
15/08/2017, 21:09:35: James: Your 'money's worth' could have been spent on body armour for our troops
15/08/2017, 21:10:13: James: Disgraceful.
15/08/2017, 21:24:28: sil: too right James. every time you go to a doctor you take up an appointment that could be used to treat one of our boys with ptsd
15/08/2017, 21:28:13: Alex Brown: Fuck soldiers

16/08/2017, 09:53:08: James: It would be tight but I could make a 630 start after work. I'm not sure when we we're back on Sunday but I'll let you know if I'm free
16/08/2017, 09:54:15: sil: might not have my bike in 2 weeks time. my dad might take it home after he comes down for anniversary party. so wanna make the most of it

23/08/2017, 09:19:43: James: Nearest outdoor trails are Epping Forrest - but they're not highly maintained so lots puddles/mud and no purpose made obstacles

23/08/2017, 09:30:03: sil: not any trails. but some decent path and we can go through the woods

23/08/2017, 10:10:15: sil: no we were doing the trails at the Olympic park
23/08/2017, 10:10:33: sil: but they close at sundown. and I can't get there till 7:30

23/08/2017, 10:33:32: Rich: Oh cool. I didn't think Stratford trails would be that big
23/08/2017, 10:33:55: sil: there not. just little technical trails
23/08/2017, 10:34:04: sil: fun bumps and slopes
23/08/2017, 10:35:41: sil: still wish I had proper mtb tires tho. may be a bit wet

23/08/2017, 10:38:09: sil: it's quite close to you really. you should give it a go. if it's muddy you won't have the right tyres thi
23/08/2017, 10:38:45: Rich: I could come from the office and drop my stuff in your car maybe
23/08/2017, 10:38:59: Rich: But yeah I guess I'll need it to be dry
23/08/2017, 10:39:14: Rich: There may be some meatier tyres  I can fit on my bike
23/08/2017, 10:42:02: James: Tbf it's largely gravel and new track that's really well maintained, apart from a few steep bits semis will be fine
23/08/2017, 10:42:28: sil: don't worry. rich can handle a semi
23/08/2017, 10:42:59: James: Lul. I'll show you the black trails this time as well.

23/08/2017, 10:43:58: James: You might struggle get into it....
23/08/2017, 10:44:03: James: *to
23/08/2017, 10:44:14: sil: are they quite tight trails?
23/08/2017, 10:47:52: James: Depends on the frequency of use
23/08/2017, 10:50:30: sil: haha. grim.

23/08/2017, 11:02:37: sil: NUT
23/08/2017, 11:08:13: James: You can actually rent bikes there and they do have a bike shop so you could probably buy and have tyres fitted if desired
23/08/2017, 11:09:53: Rich: I'd probably try my current tyres first as it'd be a pain to swap tyres or cycle everywhere on mountain bike tyres
23/08/2017, 11:10:17: sil: yeah mine are the same as yours and I was fine
23/08/2017, 11:10:25: Rich: Cool

23/08/2017, 15:03:15: James: Has Adolf ever expressed his views on exercise?
23/08/2017, 15:04:18: sil: he says exercise is important. but if you cba don't pretend you have a meeting that "might" over run
23/08/2017, 15:04:25: sil: direct quote
23/08/2017, 15:04:47: James: So wise.....
23/08/2017, 15:05:15: James: We could have learnt a lot more from this deep thinker

23/08/2017, 15:06:55: sil: his work of anti smoking campaigning?

23/08/2017, 15:07:19: James: The orange one is trying his best but as Frankie Boyle says: “Trump’s nothing like Hitler. There’s no way he could write a book.”
23/08/2017, 15:08:45: James: All heil Herr Silverwood!

24/08/2017, 08:41:02: sil: had a very vivid dream I was on a cruise ship last night. and British sea power were playing. for some reason they wernt allowed a bass drum because it would affect the ship. and in the audience is was all really old decrepit women and it was miserable
24/08/2017, 08:42:05: James: Technically a wet dream. Gross.

24/08/2017, 09:32:15: James: Maybe it wasn't a dream, maybe you did a temporary mindmeld with Rich?
24/08/2017, 09:32:27: James: Sounds highly plausible

24/08/2017, 13:53:56: sil: can't wait to go to bruge on a train and come back again
24/08/2017, 13:54:12: sil: who needs bikes for a cycling holiday??

24/08/2017, 13:56:33: sil: we will just work out our imagination
24/08/2017, 13:57:57: James: No need for that.
24/08/2017, 13:58:11: James: I was going to use Google streetview.

24/08/2017, 15:45:57: sil: pretty sure god frowns on drinking your own piss
24/08/2017, 15:48:59: sil: "Ok, so, when you find yourself in the desert, no water, it's crisis time. what you need to do now, is get on your knees and pray, very hard, for water. keep praying, god will provide. that s my top tip for desert survival."
24/08/2017, 16:24:16: James: I think you're. misinterpreting the message: god helps those who help themselves. Therefore you should pray, not for salvation but for god's strength. The strength to drink your own piss.

24/08/2017, 17:21:16: Alex Brown: James up for a drink in Holborn later

24/08/2017, 18:25:49: James: Really put me off it
24/08/2017, 18:26:29: James: No worries I'll bring my own
24/08/2017, 18:30:10: Alex Brown: It's good
24/08/2017, 18:30:14: sil: did no one tell James that the real way to serve ale is room temp.....
24/08/2017, 18:30:26: sil: London super chilled softy
24/08/2017, 18:34:06: Alex Brown: Real way the drink ale is around 13 degrees
24/08/2017, 18:34:10: Alex Brown: I tempid
24/08/2017, 18:34:32: Alex Brown: Over half room temp
24/08/2017, 18:34:41: Alex Brown: Deffo not fridge chilled
24/08/2017, 18:35:03: Alex Brown: It should be taken out of a fridge about an hour and a half
24/08/2017, 18:35:21: Alex Brown: Or stored in a garage
24/08/2017, 18:35:46: sil: No one has a garage in London
24/08/2017, 18:36:38: James: Yes yes this isn't news to me. This particular lighthouse was significantly warmer than any other I've had before or after.
24/08/2017, 18:36:52: James: Was not good.
24/08/2017, 18:36:56: Alex Brown: Comin then?

24/08/2017, 18:38:15: Alex Brown: American pale I'm drinking now is cooler
24/08/2017, 18:38:21: Alex Brown: As it should be
24/08/2017, 18:38:32: James: 21 - 24 degrees? Nope.
24/08/2017, 18:38:50: James: Maybe cellar room temp
24/08/2017, 18:38:59: Alex Brown: James
24/08/2017, 18:39:02: Alex Brown: Come
24/08/2017, 18:39:07: Alex Brown: Beer to drink
24/08/2017, 18:40:33: James: Leaving work soon
24/08/2017, 18:41:04: sil: still a room
24/08/2017, 18:41:38: James: Still got a few more bricks to count
24/08/2017, 18:47:13: sil: Alex is James skiving on you?
24/08/2017, 18:51:52: James: Silly me - my mistake. I foolishly assumed when you said room temperature you meant it in the most commonly expressed form that people frequently use day-to-day and generally without issue. Apologies, I obviously jumped the gun there.
24/08/2017, 18:52:50: James: Very embarrassing.
24/08/2017, 19:06:46: Alex Brown: Yo james
24/08/2017, 19:06:51: Alex Brown: U coming

05/09/2017, 22:44:29: James: Depends entirely on spec. You can get an Argos bike with 'full suspension' for £150...

06/09/2017, 15:07:52: Rich: Yeah it's already really dark...
06/09/2017, 15:08:13: sil: might be better to do trails on weekends now
06/09/2017, 15:08:34: Rich: We could do band practice this week maybe
06/09/2017, 15:09:07: ‎You changed this group's icon

06/09/2017, 18:24:34: Alex Brown: 18" seems like a small frame size
06/09/2017, 18:24:53: James: Cool. Seeing as it's all new why don't you ask for receipts so you can claim on the warranties should you need to do so?
06/09/2017, 18:25:41: James: Also bank transfer will get him the money quicker so why don't you suggest that?
06/09/2017, 18:26:33: James: You do want to check the frame size though as thats pretty critical
06/09/2017, 18:27:01: James: What make is the frame btw, can't make it out from pics

06/09/2017, 18:42:32: Alex Brown: This bike sounds perfect for rich
06/09/2017, 18:42:32: Alex Brown: But he's a fag and is scared of rocks
06/09/2017, 18:44:55: sil: why don't you get it for rich?
06/09/2017, 18:45:05: Alex Brown: Wasn't it rich that once said I'd rather grab a cock than grab the handlebars of a mid suspension mountain bike?
06/09/2017, 18:45:26: sil: why would rich say that?
06/09/2017, 18:45:29: sil: he loves cock
06/09/2017, 18:51:27: Alex Brown: That is true
06/09/2017, 18:51:52: Alex Brown: Maybe rich forgot how gay he was for 5s
06/09/2017, 18:52:03: sil: lol. unlikely
06/09/2017, 18:52:41: sil: that'd be like the pope forgetting he's a child rapist
06/09/2017, 18:55:29: Rich: This is like when alex bought a good guitar but it didn't actually make him good at guitar
06/09/2017, 18:56:32: Alex Brown: Rich that's nothing like when you forgot your gayness
06/09/2017, 18:56:47: Alex Brown: You must be confused

06/09/2017, 19:03:47: Rich: Tash would come help too
06/09/2017, 19:03:48: Alex Brown: I wanna try the bike so may have to be 16th

07/09/2017, 12:02:07: James: Unlike the Bull and Bladder, there were a lots of really happy and friendly people at Adnams having a nice time - just awful.
07/09/2017, 12:04:51: James: Beer is best enjoyed in brooding silence, whilst scowling at the occasional outsider who is foolish enough to wonder in.

07/09/2017, 18:51:54: Rich: Damn my secrets out!
07/09/2017, 18:52:08: Rich: There's nothing like reactionary news to send me off to sleep
07/09/2017, 18:59:22: James: "Horror-fan Heath caught on camera in crazed corpse canoodle!!!!
07/09/2017, 18:59:49: James: Click-click-click-click!!!!

08/09/2017, 13:59:58: sil: James how was the ride yesterday?
08/09/2017, 14:00:19: sil: did Alex bomb it around that long red like we were doing?
08/09/2017, 14:02:00: sil: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 14:23:11: James: Alex bombed around on the sofa, I didn't fancy it on my own so no-one we enjoyed the trails yesterday.
08/09/2017, 14:25:03: James: Alex bombed around on the sofa, I didn't fancy it on my own so no-one ~we~ enjoyed the trails yesterday.
08/09/2017, 14:26:05: James: It's thunder storms here ⛈⛈⛈

08/09/2017, 15:42:37: Rich: Is that the courgette we gave you?
08/09/2017, 15:42:53: Rich: My favourite vintage!
08/09/2017, 15:43:15: Rich: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 16:42:16: Alex Brown: Total lad
08/09/2017, 16:42:25: Alex Brown: I'm designing a pub
08/09/2017, 16:42:41: Rich: Nice
08/09/2017, 16:42:46: Rich: What's it gonna be like?
08/09/2017, 16:42:46: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 16:42:57: Alex Brown: Small
08/09/2017, 16:43:02: Rich: Is it going to be a swanky London pub?
08/09/2017, 16:43:51: Alex Brown: Next to regents park
08/09/2017, 16:44:04: Alex Brown: That's the drainage plan
08/09/2017, 16:44:12: Rich: We can go to it
08/09/2017, 16:44:12: Alex Brown: For all the piss
08/09/2017, 16:44:37: Rich: Probably super swanky
08/09/2017, 16:44:55: Rich: Still more interesting than some concrete thing in London fields
08/09/2017, 16:48:27: James: Can you subtly work your personal values into the design?
08/09/2017, 16:48:51: Rich: Make us a secret outdoor area that's hard to find for us to hang out in
08/09/2017, 16:49:48: James: E.g. can you arrange the columns so as as to block the key sight lines from the main entrance to the bar to make it as unwelcoming as possible?
08/09/2017, 16:52:03: James: Make the layout difficult to navigate in order to confuse and deter non-regulars
08/09/2017, 16:54:12: James: Have lots of corners and seating at dead ends to make it awkward when peoples eyes meet - reinforce the 'locals only' vibe
08/09/2017, 16:54:19: Rich: Put a deep and wide cantilever over the sign to shade the name
08/09/2017, 16:55:24: James: Have lots of excessively deep downstand beams to promote stagnation of the air
08/09/2017, 17:14:44: sil: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 17:17:03: Rich: Nice

08/09/2017, 18:07:48: Alex Brown: Yeh quite normal
08/09/2017, 18:08:11: Alex Brown: Hence why it's big and square

08/09/2017, 19:01:17: Alex Brown: Good pick me up after a long stressful week
08/09/2017, 19:02:02: Rich: Hahaha wtf?
08/09/2017, 19:02:09: sil: what's the parcel?
NOW?
08/09/2017, 19:02:17: sil: NOS!
08/09/2017, 19:02:39: Rich: You won't order it to your flat but it's fine if your mum collects it?
08/09/2017, 19:02:52: Rich: Don't do too much nos and die before they can get your organs out...
08/09/2017, 19:03:22: sil: your mom is such a daily mail reader
08/09/2017, 19:03:32: Rich: I bet she got that from the daily mail
08/09/2017, 19:03:59: sil: pretty sure they don't harvest the organs while alive
08/09/2017, 19:04:34: Rich: It seems pretty unlikely
08/09/2017, 19:04:50: Rich: Maybe it's better for some sensitive organs, but I doubt it's common practice
08/09/2017, 19:05:35: Alex Brown: Forgot to change the address to office
08/09/2017, 19:05:35: Alex Brown: 1L off coffee syrup
08/09/2017, 19:05:35: Alex Brown: They do if your brain dead
08/09/2017, 19:05:55: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 19:06:02: sil: your mom is a worrier
08/09/2017, 19:06:18: Rich: She's way beyond just worrying about firing
08/09/2017, 19:06:19: James: Give it a double column base and and a massive head.
08/09/2017, 19:06:20: Rich: Dying
08/09/2017, 19:06:28: James: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 19:06:54: Rich: She's not only thought about dying and about you dying but also is so far past those dark notions that she worries about the grotesque aftermath
08/09/2017, 19:08:00: Alex Brown: Ha good point, architect fucked up
08/09/2017, 19:08:05: sil: <‎image omitted>
08/09/2017, 19:08:45: Alex Brown: Those are to basement where the normal people toilets are
08/09/2017, 19:11:18: James: I think she's accepted the inevitable and would like your organs. Except your liver (obviously)... or lungs... or sinuses.. or eyes. Actually, second thought that's probably not it.
08/09/2017, 19:12:47: James: Yeah lift looks undersized too. Architect probably hates our heroes as much as Alex
08/09/2017, 19:13:35: sil: alot of our hero's are wheely people now
08/09/2017, 19:13:55: sil: because they've earned the right to sit down all the time
08/09/2017, 19:14:20: James: Are you saying they weren't wheely people before?
08/09/2017, 19:14:27: James: Traitor!!
08/09/2017, 19:14:55: James: Our troops become heroes the day they sign up.
08/09/2017, 19:15:49: sil: yes. even when they gain they're hot wheels, there're still hero's
08/09/2017, 19:17:14: James: Even with half a body they're still twice the men we are.
08/09/2017, 19:17:53: James: 🇽🇪🇽🇪🇽🇪💂🏻💂🏻💂🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
08/09/2017, 19:18:07: sil: I wouldn't go that far.....
they become just as much man as us once they become broken
08/09/2017, 19:18:48: Alex Brown: Soldiers r scum
08/09/2017, 19:19:05: sil: and what about the disabled?
08/09/2017, 19:19:28: James: They're quadruple the men we are then
08/09/2017, 19:20:13: James: They're octuple the man Alex is because he's barely half a man to begin with
08/09/2017, 19:20:43: sil: I so rarely see Alex use his legs I'm beginning to think he's half wheel man

09/09/2017, 17:10:50: James: Nah 2.80 - cuz you have *definitely* sought out the very cheapest pub in the vicinity
09/09/2017, 17:55:56: sil: nope. just above average 3.45
09/09/2017, 17:56:22: sil: what's Wales coming to!?!?

11/09/2017, 12:33:19: sil: I'm easy for which ever.
11/09/2017, 13:23:58: ‎sil changed this group's icon
11/09/2017, 13:33:49: Alex Brown: I would prefer this weekend
11/09/2017, 13:34:03: Alex Brown: I have a free houe
11/09/2017, 13:34:19: Alex Brown: And it's not my moms bday
11/09/2017, 13:34:23: Alex Brown: You should feel bad
11/09/2017, 13:34:32: Alex Brown: Why can't she come this weekend
11/09/2017, 13:34:42: Rich: She's in York Saturday
11/09/2017, 13:34:56: Rich: You're going up the weekend after anyway?
11/09/2017, 13:35:03: sil: if she's in York surely you can't really see her any way
11/09/2017, 13:35:11: Rich: Well Sunday
11/09/2017, 13:35:23: Rich: I get back today and then she goes to York Wednesday till Saturday
11/09/2017, 13:35:55: Rich: So we want to hang out Saturday evening/Sunday
11/09/2017, 13:40:40: sil: again I'm cool for whenever. doesn't make a difference to me.
but if Alex has to spend a whole day not crushing apples and doing birthday stuff then that'd be lame
11/09/2017, 13:52:42: Alex Brown: Yeh
11/09/2017, 13:52:50: Alex Brown: Tash is away rich
11/09/2017, 13:53:02: Alex Brown: You'll see her on Sunday night anyway
11/09/2017, 13:53:11: Alex Brown: Let's do this weekend
11/09/2017, 14:24:09: James: Is Nicola going with you or is Jasmine coming this weekend?
11/09/2017, 20:44:20: sil: look @447753461116 it's a pleb getting married outside your house

11/09/2017, 20:54:49: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
11/09/2017, 20:55:28: Alex Brown: Did she fall out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down?
11/09/2017, 20:57:16: sil: I fancy her

12/09/2017, 09:44:19: sil: yeah me and Alex are gonna drive over for an equipment audit
12/09/2017, 09:44:52: Rich: Er yeah that should be fine
12/09/2017, 09:45:24: sil: how many of those clear barrels are at yours?
12/09/2017, 09:45:51: Rich: Like 5 or 6 I think
12/09/2017, 09:46:29: Rich: There's also a bunch of junk, some sterilising stuff and lots of bottles
12/09/2017, 09:46:43: Rich: I guess we mainly need the barrels and sterilising stuff for now
12/09/2017, 09:48:25: sil: yeah. need barrels, sterelant and the cap things
12/09/2017, 09:50:58: sil: need to be more picky with apples this year. get sweet ones only.
and maybe we should try washing the apples first. set up a little Apple bath
12/09/2017, 10:22:35: Alex Brown: True dat
12/09/2017, 10:22:47: Alex Brown: Need to wash the apples
12/09/2017, 10:23:09: Alex Brown: I'm gonna fill 4 glass demijohns with nicer apple juice
12/09/2017, 10:23:20: Alex Brown: And try make some wine
12/09/2017, 10:23:26: Rich: We should have trained the infrared scanner I have to recognise sweet apples
12/09/2017, 10:23:44: Rich: With some extra sugar?
12/09/2017, 10:23:54: Alex Brown: Yep
12/09/2017, 10:24:03: Alex Brown: And champagne yeast
12/09/2017, 10:24:10: Alex Brown: Gonna rack it lots
12/09/2017, 10:24:14: Rich: Cool
12/09/2017, 10:30:55: Alex Brown: Get rid of the crap that gives awful hangovers
12/09/2017, 10:43:49: Rich: Rack is as in rebottle it?
12/09/2017, 10:45:13: sil: that's when you rebottle to remove settled sediment
12/09/2017, 10:51:10: James: <‎GIF omitted>
12/09/2017, 11:07:29: Rich: Ah ok.

If that's done wrong it probably makes the hangover worse by oxidising some of the alcohol
12/09/2017, 11:07:43: Rich: We can make much more than 40L
12/09/2017, 11:09:55: James: Prove it
12/09/2017, 11:11:41: sil: true. last time we did it via syphon. but we did have to open the lid to get it in.
would be best if we can find a way to keep a tight seal and rack
12/09/2017, 11:11:44: James: <‎GIF omitted>
12/09/2017, 11:19:07: Rich: It should be ok to open the lid as long as there's still a good layer of CO2 sat on top
12/09/2017, 11:19:42: Rich: Well we have 5+ 20 litre barrels so that's at least 100 litres
12/09/2017, 11:30:25: James: Nice. How many apples is that then?
12/09/2017, 11:30:38: Rich: lots
12/09/2017, 11:30:39: Rich: http://www.cider.org.uk/identification_of_cider_apples.pdf
12/09/2017, 11:40:54: sil: we should do trails next Sunday everyone free.
getting too dark to do after work now
12/09/2017, 12:08:57: Rich: yeah
12/09/2017, 12:08:59: Rich: https://www.beerhawk.co.uk/brix-specific-gravity-refractometer-w-atc?___store=beerhawk&LGWCODE=2491;124807;7567&utm_source=Lengow&utm_term=Lengow_GS&utm_medium=Lengow_GS&utm_campaign=Lengow_GS&gclid=Cj0KCQjwi97NBRD1ARIsAPXVWWBQdP0F54I7zUgbyTzeDSxdOI83X83x6bvBLehgt8Jivg_deVX_m4EaAoMMEALw_wcB
12/09/2017, 12:09:10: Rich: Brix is like the quality guide for fruit
12/09/2017, 12:09:31: Rich: so if we put in for one of those we could test apples at different places to find out which were the sweetest/best
12/09/2017, 12:22:10: sil: nice. order it. we can put in
12/09/2017, 12:22:41: sil: probs won't come in time tho
12/09/2017, 13:09:05: sil: rich still up for St Albans beer fest weekend of 29th?

12/09/2017, 15:25:13: sil: we only have a single day to pick apples and a single day to press

15/09/2017, 09:42:32: James: Nah that was an unrelated incident last night at the MOBO Awards. Apparently the perpetrator has been quoted as having "bars for days.."
15/09/2017, 09:43:09: sil: it was the mercury awards last night James. just cause a black guy won doesn't make it the mobos
15/09/2017, 09:44:01: James: I know but MOBO suited my joke better
15/09/2017, 09:44:19: James: Who won?

15/09/2017, 09:55:16: James: ..its a cold world out there.
15/09/2017, 09:55:16: sil: to be fair. Kate tempest comes across as a bit working class....which is a shame
15/09/2017, 09:55:24: James: 😢
15/09/2017, 09:56:38: sil: why arnt there rappers who rap about when you forget your suit trousers the day before ascot!

15/09/2017, 09:57:47: James: Stuff that matters
15/09/2017, 09:59:27: sil: or like when you eat an entire salmon roulade as a starter but forget it's only the starter and your too full for the beef Wellington main!
15/09/2017, 10:01:09: James: I think ed sheeran did a track about that
15/09/2017, 10:01:36: James: Apparently it was pure FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
15/09/2017, 10:03:41: sil: rappers should rap about that awful scenario when you lend your holiday home too a close, but because they're staying in it, your not making anything on Air B&B for that week.

19/09/2017, 16:09:42: James: I don't like the unbalanced sexual distinction conveyed in this poster. Feels regressive.
19/09/2017, 16:12:00: sil: 5 female surfers = 1 male neuroscientist
19/09/2017, 16:13:23: James: <‎image omitted>

19/09/2017, 16:40:50: Alex Brown: I just spent the afternoon making up pile loads for my building control pack
19/09/2017, 16:41:01: Alex Brown: Because it's built wrong
19/09/2017, 16:41:49: Alex Brown: I'm good at hiding under designed foundations
19/09/2017, 16:42:32: Rich: Terrifying
19/09/2017, 16:44:55: Alex Brown: Sallright
19/09/2017, 16:45:03: James: Make-up won't shield you from the truth. Building Control always get their man.
19/09/2017, 16:45:12: Alex Brown: They times our loads by 3
19/09/2017, 16:45:23: Alex Brown: When they design piles
19/09/2017, 16:45:37: Alex Brown: These are only 1.1over
19/09/2017, 17:08:15: Rich: I'm not sure what those words mean but I think they translate roughly as a gleeful disregard for the lives of others
19/09/2017, 17:22:40: James: In layman's terms I think it means "If the consultant engineer for your building was named Alex Brown, one is advised to exit immediately via the nearest window".
19/09/2017, 17:32:59: Alex Brown: It's fine
19/09/2017, 17:33:14: Alex Brown: We double loaded the roof at the early stage
19/09/2017, 17:33:22: Alex Brown: I've checked back

19/09/2017, 17:49:53: Alex Brown: Would you like me to go through my list of all time favourite concrete finishes?
19/09/2017, 17:50:44: Alex Brown: Power floated is way up there
19/09/2017, 17:51:31: sil: my favourite concrete finish is the super concrete head buster slam move

19/09/2017, 17:56:18: James: @447753461116 I would have thought that you would have preferred a high ratio sand-to-cement screed on account that you both lack integrity
19/09/2017, 18:04:11: Alex Brown: Bet you couldn't even tell the difference between hand troweled and polished
19/09/2017, 18:04:14: Alex Brown: Embarrassing
19/09/2017, 18:10:39: Alex Brown: I would assume you prefer a 225 deep slab in comparison to an 850 transfer deck cus u suck balls
19/09/2017, 18:11:38: James: Or perhaps you would favour an epoxy resin, in that you both promise exceptional reliability, but in practice results often tend to disappoint

20/09/2017, 15:25:42: Rich: You know dots usually indicate thinking rather than speech right?
20/09/2017, 15:26:08: Rich: I've got it in my head that every time a character in a comic was supposed to be thinking you've interpreted it as them saying their thoughts
20/09/2017, 15:26:17: sil: yeah. but it's easier to scribble dots
20/09/2017, 15:26:21: James: +1
20/09/2017, 15:26:24: Rich: Ha I thought as much
20/09/2017, 15:26:42: sil: otherwise I'd have to draw lines and fill in
20/09/2017, 15:28:14: James: <‎image omitted>
20/09/2017, 15:28:30: sil: +1 happy to be behind him
20/09/2017, 15:28:38: Rich: I guess the ambiguity with alex is fine
20/09/2017, 15:28:49: Rich: Because he basically thinks out of his mouth anyway
20/09/2017, 15:29:06: sil: +1
20/09/2017, 15:29:51: James: Maybe Sil was suggesting he _wanted_ to say something gay (like 'say pinot')but didn't have the courage?

20/09/2017, 15:48:36: sil: why would he say "sad face" while smiling
20/09/2017, 15:49:25: James: Now who's the 'pedantic bell-sniff'?
20/09/2017, 15:50:19: sil: probably Rich. he's a pretty pedantic bell-sniff
20/09/2017, 15:50:57: James: In any case, Alex is brave and strong, he wouldn't let such a trivial matter ruin someone's wedding photo.
20/09/2017, 15:51:33: James: He would put on a brave face no matter what as he's a top lad.
20/09/2017, 15:51:43: Rich: I think there are multiple pedantic bell-sniffs, rendering the definite article "the" inappropriate
20/09/2017, 15:52:29: James: Rich has joined the club. Welcome friend.

21/09/2017, 18:46:44: sil: I've either got a very light high or just small placebo

24/09/2017, 14:59:05: sil: does your mom not want it?
24/09/2017, 14:59:10: sil: Alex
24/09/2017, 15:54:16: Alex Brown: No
24/09/2017, 15:54:20: Alex Brown: She just said
24/09/2017, 15:54:38: Alex Brown: Do as you wish with it
24/09/2017, 15:54:49: Alex Brown: But if you sell it take the money
24/09/2017, 15:55:00: Alex Brown: And invest it in the cider fund
24/09/2017, 15:55:21: Alex Brown: Get us some nice labels
24/09/2017, 15:55:46: Alex Brown: And some cider flavourings
24/09/2017, 17:34:57: Rich: If I sell it for the cider fund it will pay the cider funds debts to me
24/09/2017, 17:42:13: Alex Brown: Hmm I don't approve of that
24/09/2017, 17:42:31: Alex Brown: If there is any extra put it back in
24/09/2017, 17:42:53: Alex Brown: Me and sil may have to sell it
24/09/2017, 17:43:01: Alex Brown: I sense dishonesty
24/09/2017, 18:18:43: sil: we paid for the press materials
24/09/2017, 18:19:11: Alex Brown: Indeed
24/09/2017, 18:20:54: sil: oh and the time we put in building and designing
24/09/2017, 18:21:26: Alex Brown: Maybe we should invoice him
24/09/2017, 18:22:36: sil: and all that free cider you drank from our last 2 pressing years
24/09/2017, 23:19:37: sil: <‎image omitted>
25/09/2017, 07:21:07: Rich: Hopulent

26/09/2017, 11:06:02: Rich: I'm glad Facebook finally clarified what a preview is
26/09/2017, 11:06:23: Rich: This basically means that 4 people decided our page wasn't worth going on
26/09/2017, 11:07:57: sil: yeah I wasn't sure what that was
26/09/2017, 13:34:53: Rich: Look Alex there's a new youth worker to put you back on track!

26/09/2017, 13:36:39: Alex Brown: Heavy petting
26/09/2017, 13:37:25: Rich: It's so much more upbeat than Bridgnorth Chats
26/09/2017, 13:38:13: sil: I wouldn't let him work my youth
26/09/2017, 13:38:48: sil: ask him the best place to smoke a spliff in the church yard
26/09/2017, 13:39:24: Alex Brown: I already know that well
26/09/2017, 13:39:50: sil: ask him howcome church's don't pay for tax. scrounging bastards
26/09/2017, 13:40:22: Alex Brown: Scum
26/09/2017, 13:40:38: Alex Brown: In your local park james
26/09/2017, 13:41:33: Alex Brown: Having a chill on the grass
26/09/2017, 13:42:50: sil: why arnt you working?
26/09/2017, 13:43:06: sil: and don't fob me off with that "lunch" excuse
26/09/2017, 13:43:36: James: What park?
26/09/2017, 13:43:37: Alex Brown: I'm on my break now
26/09/2017, 13:43:45: Alex Brown: Having a nap
26/09/2017, 13:43:58: Alex Brown: Do not disturb
26/09/2017, 13:44:11: James: Sleepmessaging eh? Nice
26/09/2017, 21:41:57: sil: <‎image omitted>
26/09/2017, 21:42:36: sil: <‎image omitted>
26/09/2017, 21:44:39: Rich: People have literally gone to prison for doing that
26/09/2017, 21:44:57: Rich: Let's hope Betsy doesn't change her mind on whether it was ok
26/09/2017, 21:45:30: sil: haha. this book came out in like 1994 so I guess she would have done by now
26/09/2017, 21:46:23: sil: it's funny how recent the taboo on that sort of thing is really. I guess in 1967 it was alot more prevalent
26/09/2017, 21:47:10: sil: I guess still taboo. but alot more enforced now
26/09/2017, 21:47:42: sil: I can't imagine iggy pop would admit that if the book came out today even
26/09/2017, 21:54:15: Rich: Yeah it's really become a big issue in the last decade
26/09/2017, 21:54:25: Rich: It's crazy how fast culture has changed
26/09/2017, 21:54:58: Rich: I guess the 60s and 70s liberation and experimentation were the birth of modern open culture, but new norms hadn't been established yet
27/09/2017, 08:27:56: sil: another thing I've learnt from this book is Nico, from velvet underground & Nico fame, slept with basically everyone at that time
27/09/2017, 08:28:49: sil: bob Dylan, lou reed, John cale, Jim morrissin, iggy pop
27/09/2017, 08:33:12: Rich: Woah that's quite the ensemble
27/09/2017, 08:34:18: sil: and that's only so far.
I also know she ended up living in Manchester with the fall at some point
27/09/2017, 08:45:42: Alex Brown: Rock star model
27/09/2017, 08:45:52: Alex Brown: Of course she slept with everyone
27/09/2017, 09:39:30: James: I'm trying to decide whether to travel back to Bristol late on Friday night, or early on Sat morning (9am + hangover..). I'm thinking Fri to get it out of way and have a much nicer Saturday. What time do you think we'll be leaving St Albans?
27/09/2017, 09:40:32: sil: not sure. when drunk enough.
I guess you can just leave  when you need to
27/09/2017, 09:42:11: James: It ends at 11pm and last coach is around midnight. Assume we probably won't make it to the very end though if we start at 2pm.... 🤤
27/09/2017, 09:42:50: Rich: Jesus I didn't realise it went on for 9 hours
27/09/2017, 09:44:13: sil: haha indeed.
is it an easy journey to Bristol from there?
27/09/2017, 09:44:40: Rich: I imagine he has to go through London
27/09/2017, 09:45:58: Rich: What's the address of the beer festival and what time do you guys expect to arrive?
27/09/2017, 09:46:59: sil: Alban Arena.
I will be there around 2
27/09/2017, 09:49:16: Rich: Cool
27/09/2017, 09:49:48: James: Slightly annoying route, have to go to Victoria then get coach from there. It's £18 return, whereas train is about £70 and that means going to Paddington any way
27/09/2017, 09:51:20: James: Just hope they'll let me on the coach... 😆
27/09/2017, 10:02:52: sil: don't worry, Alex has never been rejected from a train before
27/09/2017, 10:03:06: sil: so you'll be fine
27/09/2017, 11:50:51: sil: <‎image omitted>
27/09/2017, 12:43:33: Rich: Haha
27/09/2017, 12:43:48: Rich: It does sound like he was a massive prick
27/09/2017, 13:17:48: sil: yeah he was. took alot of amphetimine. was pretty manipulative and jealous.
27/09/2017, 13:18:44: sil: prescription amphetimine really was the drug of choice in 60's new York
27/09/2017, 13:20:16: sil: alot of persceiption barbiturates too
27/09/2017, 13:42:30: Rich: Must have been a mental time
28/09/2017, 09:24:20: Alex Brown: Just bought a raspberry pi 3 rich
28/09/2017, 09:24:41: Rich: Cool
28/09/2017, 09:24:47: Rich: What are you going to do with it?
28/09/2017, 09:56:36: sil: any ideas what i can do for my birthday?
28/09/2017, 09:56:56: Rich: Shall we take crack?
28/09/2017, 09:57:15: sil: I wanna go drinking. but maybe somewhere with live music. somewhere slightly more eventful than a pub but not over crowded and lame
28/09/2017, 09:57:18: sil: crack, sure
28/09/2017, 09:57:29: Rich: We could go to jazz cafe or something similar
28/09/2017, 09:58:17: sil: yeah that's what I was thinking. not anything interesting on tho
28/09/2017, 09:58:36: sil: at jazz cafe frody 6th
28/09/2017, 09:58:37: Rich: Hmm
28/09/2017, 09:59:02: Rich: What other venues are there?
28/09/2017, 09:59:23: Rich: Blues kitchen, cesil sharo
28/09/2017, 10:06:32: sil: callidh is on again.

28/09/2017, 10:17:55: Alex Brown: Me and Nicola bought a cheap Samsung TV last night for the bedroom
28/09/2017, 10:18:16: Alex Brown: So I got one with Kodi installed
28/09/2017, 10:18:28: Alex Brown: To act as a media centre
28/09/2017, 10:18:49: sil: why didn't you just bring your tv from home down
28/09/2017, 10:18:58: Rich: Oh nice
28/09/2017, 10:19:00: Alex Brown: Wanna install some emulators and you have the connection
28/09/2017, 10:19:06: Alex Brown: It's too bulky
28/09/2017, 10:19:16: Alex Brown: We have a small room
28/09/2017, 10:19:24: Rich: Yeah you should install the classic consoles emulator
28/09/2017, 10:19:42: Rich: But you basically have to install that as an OS so you probably couldn't also use it as an emulator
28/09/2017, 10:19:47: Rich: Media centre
28/09/2017, 10:19:47: Alex Brown: It would interfere with the only corridor we have in the room
28/09/2017, 10:20:03: Rich: You already have a lot of stuff in your flat
28/09/2017, 10:20:07: Alex Brown: Oh

28/09/2017, 10:25:06: Rich: There's stuff like that where is downloads torrents to a hard drive automatically
28/09/2017, 10:25:25: Rich: Like you give it an address where a series gets uploaded and it downloads them in the background for you
28/09/2017, 10:26:05: sil: I have no idea what it is
28/09/2017, 10:26:05: Alex Brown: What are you doing
28/09/2017, 10:26:12: Alex Brown: U have android
28/09/2017, 10:26:14: sil: is it like a rip off Chromecast?
28/09/2017, 10:26:17: Alex Brown: Install it
28/09/2017, 10:26:23: Alex Brown: And get covenant
28/09/2017, 11:27:16: James: I am also curious to learn the answer to this. What do you do with yours Rich?
28/09/2017, 11:28:13: Rich: It's currently controls the dancestallation we're making
28/09/2017, 11:28:37: James: Niiice. That avoids the whole desktop pc too right?
28/09/2017, 11:28:55: Rich: I was thinking of hooking it up to the DMX lights I have and imitating the Hue API to make a ghetto version of Hue lights
28/09/2017, 11:29:16: James: And old 😜
28/09/2017, 11:30:42: sil: what's wrong with watching t.v. in the living room?
28/09/2017, 11:31:02: James: Crack is the craic for sure
28/09/2017, 11:31:04: sil: literally on the other side of the wall your new tv will be on
28/09/2017, 11:33:01: James: Hopefully my phone can run it too? Would be pretty awesome to get Kodi, was going to suggest it for lounge
28/09/2017, 11:33:05: Alex Brown: Because i can lie in bed and watch films
28/09/2017, 11:33:49: Alex Brown: And i can easily escape nicolas crap itv murder misteries that plague me

28/09/2017, 11:35:18: Alex Brown: Ha u suffer
28/09/2017, 11:35:20: Alex Brown: Not me
28/09/2017, 11:35:26: James: That sounds pretty cool. Hue is awesome but pricey
28/09/2017, 11:36:25: James: Ok yoda....
28/09/2017, 11:36:31: Alex Brown: Richs version of hue lights are abraisive and counter relaxing
28/09/2017, 11:36:53: Rich: I'll make your Hue lights abrasive
28/09/2017, 11:37:14: James: NUT
28/09/2017, 11:39:49: sil: nicola watches ITV??......
28/09/2017, 11:40:59: sil: I'm sorry alex. I didn't realise things were getting that bad at home
28/09/2017, 11:42:30: Rich: Urgh ITV
28/09/2017, 11:42:53: Rich: Is it those scandi ones that are all the rage?
28/09/2017, 11:43:25: Rich: ITV news is news for people that need their information to feel like a soap
28/09/2017, 11:45:51: James: Nah it's midsummer murders, tropical midsummer murders, investigation of American murders with that angel guy from Buffy the vampire slayer, and real life murder documentaries.
28/09/2017, 11:46:15: sil: apparently people who watch ITV are are high risk of watching Britain's Got Talent.
it's scary when you think about it
28/09/2017, 11:46:21: Rich: There's a tropical midsummer murders? That sounds like a contradiction
28/09/2017, 11:46:36: Rich: That is scary
28/09/2017, 11:47:07: James: It is literally *nothing* but programmes about murder. It's actually quite morbid.
28/09/2017, 11:47:50: James: Um tropical murders is exactly like midsummer but is set on a Caribbean island
28/09/2017, 11:48:14: sil: I don't remember the murder in ant and Decs Saturday night take away
28/09/2017, 11:49:16: Rich: They were murdering the sensibilities of the viewer
28/09/2017, 11:49:15: James: That's not included in our nightly schedule
28/09/2017, 11:49:24: Alex Brown: its awful
28/09/2017, 11:49:28: Rich: Why do you watch so much murder?
28/09/2017, 11:49:33: Alex Brown: #james watches game of thrones
28/09/2017, 11:49:40: Rich: Are the Benton girls actually psychopaths?
28/09/2017, 11:49:43: Alex Brown: the level of tv at hereford rd
28/09/2017, 11:49:49: Rich: Depressing
28/09/2017, 11:49:49: Alex Brown: is sub standard
28/09/2017, 11:49:55: sil: why are you guys so whipped by your girlfriends that you can't control the TV?
28/09/2017, 11:50:16: Alex Brown: i do control the tv when i caan
28/09/2017, 11:50:18: Rich: Tash and I have a healthy balance ranging from Bojack to Grand Designs
28/09/2017, 11:50:25: James: I don't have a girlfriend, keep up
28/09/2017, 11:50:40: James: I don't watch tv
28/09/2017, 11:50:58: James: It's not productive
28/09/2017, 11:51:28: James: Stream the odd thing but that's pretty much it
28/09/2017, 11:53:06: sil: you should watch more action films
28/09/2017, 11:53:10: sil: and stuff with violence
28/09/2017, 11:53:49: James: Like a top lad 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
28/09/2017, 11:53:51: sil: oh wait. violence is banned in your flat
28/09/2017, 11:54:07: Rich: Murder isn't violent?
28/09/2017, 11:54:09: James: Is it?
28/09/2017, 11:54:28: James: Must have missed the memo
28/09/2017, 12:08:59: Rich: "I'm going to need fatty eggs, big, fatty eggs."
24-year-old Alex Brown had given up on his life's ambition to become a engineer.
However, at a mayonaise running out he discovers some illogical wankers trying to eat his illogical girlfriend, Ben Lester, and he decides it's time for change.
In need of some cheeses and fatty eggs, fat and gay Alex pops to Alverley for a bit of shopping.
Having led a wasteful life, Alex finds himself unable to find fatty eggs in Alverley. So he sets out to acquire some fatty eggs from Bridgnorth instead.
Soon, he has all the fatty eggs he needs and begins secretly applying for engineer jobs. He soon realises that illogical wankers plan to sabotage his new career prospects and decides to take action.
However, Alex finds himself troubled by his wasteful ideals and becomes overwhelmed with moral questions. Will his conscience allow him to do whatever is needed to stop the illogical wankers?
"Are we seriously supposed to find a fat and gay engineer from Alverley heroic?"

01/10/2017, 21:18:25: Alex Brown: Would be nice
01/10/2017, 21:18:56: sil: could yet some 2cb and some ecstasy pills
01/10/2017, 21:19:03: sil: mix and match
01/10/2017, 21:19:22: Alex Brown: I fancy taking a pill in bits over the evening
01/10/2017, 21:19:33: Alex Brown: Ill probs do that
01/10/2017, 21:19:47: Alex Brown: Like quarter at a time
01/10/2017, 21:19:55: Alex Brown: I enjoyed it that way
01/10/2017, 21:20:29: Alex Brown: More energetic and happy laughing high
01/10/2017, 21:20:37: sil: <‎image omitted>
01/10/2017, 21:21:24: Alex Brown: The fuck is that
01/10/2017, 21:21:37: sil: pills
01/10/2017, 21:22:11: sil: "see no evil" pills
01/10/2017, 21:22:39: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
01/10/2017, 21:22:58: sil: all the pills I've had have been stronger than Crystal stuff. guess cus it has speed and stuff in as well
01/10/2017, 21:23:08: Alex Brown: Theyve arranged those badly
01/10/2017, 21:23:15: sil: ha nice
01/10/2017, 21:23:55: Alex Brown: 🙈🙉🙊
01/10/2017, 21:24:02: sil: let's get those Alex instead
01/10/2017, 21:24:08: Alex Brown: Nah
01/10/2017, 21:24:16: Alex Brown: I want 2cs bro
01/10/2017, 21:24:34: Alex Brown: Fuck taking 3 of those
01/10/2017, 21:26:01: sil: 2cs is great.
but made me wanna hang out at home more
01/10/2017, 21:26:22: Alex Brown: Yeh i think the trip was too hard
01/10/2017, 21:26:33: Alex Brown: Im gonna get drunk with them this time
01/10/2017, 21:26:36: sil: nah trip was good
01/10/2017, 21:26:59: Alex Brown: It was too intense for where was
01/10/2017, 21:27:13: Alex Brown: I wanna control the dose and drink with it
01/10/2017, 21:27:22: sil: just the nature of tripping like is best in a nice warm environment
01/10/2017, 21:39:03: Rich: One sends you blind, one deaf and the other dumb
01/10/2017, 22:39:27: Alex Brown: So those are the positives what about the side effects?
01/10/2017, 22:48:25: sil: if you get 2cs tho Alex I'll have a quater and swap you some md
01/10/2017, 22:49:05: Alex Brown: K i might have a little then
01/10/2017, 22:49:07: Alex Brown: Deal
02/10/2017, 09:12:13: Rich: You urinate out of your mouth
02/10/2017, 09:47:17: sil: sound convenient. don't even need to unbutton your trousers
02/10/2017, 09:47:33: Rich: That's basically what I did on Friday night
02/10/2017, 09:48:04: sil: eww
02/10/2017, 09:48:05: sil: did you through up when you got home?
02/10/2017, 09:48:21: Rich: No on the way to that pub
02/10/2017, 09:48:35: Rich: I basically just wretched up some foam and carried on drinking
02/10/2017, 09:48:42: sil: lad
02/10/2017, 09:48:50: sil: making room for the next pint
02/10/2017, 09:49:10: Rich: Exactly
02/10/2017, 09:49:23: Rich: I could have easily throw up at Sean's I think but I didn't
02/10/2017, 09:49:27: Rich: Mad lad skills
02/10/2017, 09:49:54: sil: can't wait to get my official camra membership card
02/10/2017, 09:51:31: Rich: Very exciting
02/10/2017, 09:51:43: Rich: I'm going to become an alcoholic to make use of these vouchers
02/10/2017, 09:53:06: ‎You changed this group's icon
02/10/2017, 09:54:43: James: I think Wetherspoons serve alcohol from 8am
02/10/2017, 09:55:05: Rich: Oh I just got my membership email!
02/10/2017, 10:45:44: sil: that's what I was thinking
 seems a shame to waste them by not being an alcoholic
02/10/2017, 10:46:57: Rich: To be fair it is only 10 pints over every 2 months so you really only have to drink a pint at Wetherspoons a little more than once a week
02/10/2017, 10:49:11: James: What benefits does Camra bring post festival then, aside from these vouchers?
02/10/2017, 10:49:34: Rich: We get money of Cotswold outdoors
02/10/2017, 10:49:39: Rich: And national express
02/10/2017, 10:49:48: Rich: Also cheap or free entry to other beer festivals
02/10/2017, 10:50:25: James: Now you're talking
02/10/2017, 10:50:27: Rich: 20% off brewery tours
02/10/2017, 10:50:40: James: When's the next festival?
02/10/2017, 10:50:48: Rich: We can go to social events
02/10/2017, 10:50:59: James: Assume there's a calendar online?
02/10/2017, 10:51:01: Rich: I've already had an email regarding a big one next summer
02/10/2017, 10:51:10: James: No more this year?
02/10/2017, 10:51:23: James: Cool
02/10/2017, 10:51:29: James: Gay
02/10/2017, 10:51:39: Rich: http://www.camra.org.uk/events
02/10/2017, 10:53:30: James: That's awesome, will have to study in that in detail later
02/10/2017, 10:54:44: James: They normally have one in Bristol that's supposed to be really good
02/10/2017, 10:54:58: James: Always sells out really quick
02/10/2017, 10:56:12: sil: not if your a camra member
02/10/2017, 11:06:57: James: Do they hold a reserve?
02/10/2017, 11:07:28: Rich: No they remove plebs if we arrive to a full event
02/10/2017, 11:07:33: Rich: Plebs like yourself
02/10/2017, 11:14:30: James: <‎GIF omitted>
02/10/2017, 11:30:52: sil: haha a reserve??
please.
tickets are for plebs
02/10/2017, 11:38:37: sil: our membership cards open doors
02/10/2017, 11:42:54: James: Yeah, doors that nobody would want to go through. Like the entrance to a Wetherspoons.
02/10/2017, 11:43:14: James: Or a Camra social 😂
02/10/2017, 11:44:40: ‎James changed the subject to “First Class Louts 🍻🍻🍻🚂”
02/10/2017, 12:03:08: sil: <‎image omitted>
02/10/2017, 12:18:06: James: Makes sense. Only posh twats have enough money to pay a £25 surcharge to drink in a Wetherspoons
02/10/2017, 12:30:29: James: <‎image omitted>
02/10/2017, 12:50:54: sil: 4.15 for "naked" veg???
02/10/2017, 13:04:31: sil: you could literally buy and boil that for £1
02/10/2017, 13:04:32: sil: less even
02/10/2017, 13:17:16: James: Hah - you could a whole broccoli for a quid
02/10/2017, 13:20:02: James: So utterly retarded - punish your taste buds by necking that shit for its 'goodness', completely ignoring the fact your pouring an unnaturally high dose of liquid sugar down your throat by way of the apple juice it's mixed with...
02/10/2017, 13:42:41: Alex Brown: Vital is disgusting
02/10/2017, 13:45:09: Alex Brown: Id rather run blindfolded through a room full of cocks than go there for lunch
02/10/2017, 13:45:10: Alex Brown: Id probably walk away fuller
02/10/2017, 13:48:04: James: At least you'd get the protein you crave so much...
02/10/2017, 13:48:53: sil: wouldn't you rather do that than most things?
02/10/2017, 13:50:15: Alex Brown: True dat
02/10/2017, 13:50:20: Alex Brown: But still
02/10/2017, 13:57:20: James: So what particularly don't you like about Vital?
02/10/2017, 15:06:11: Alex Brown: The food
02/10/2017, 15:15:15: James: You don't like food?
02/10/2017, 15:16:31: sil: he doesn't like vegetables
02/10/2017, 15:20:21: James: A case of self-loathing?
02/10/2017, 21:29:21: Rich: I just saw Peter Capaldi riding a Boris Bike through Westminster
02/10/2017, 21:31:26: sil: nice.
you sure it was him?
02/10/2017, 21:33:07: sil: decided to go hemingford arms for birthday. can't think of any restaurant thing to do.
havnt been there in a while
02/10/2017, 21:35:18: Rich: Oh that'd be nice
02/10/2017, 21:35:23: Rich: We can get Thai
02/10/2017, 21:35:31: Rich: 99% sure
02/10/2017, 21:36:02: Rich: He basically cut us up by turning right as we were crossing the street
02/10/2017, 21:40:04: sil: checked online and the folk should be on. so that's cool.

ha that's funny.
you should have yelled some Malcolm Tucker expletive at him
02/10/2017, 21:40:24: Rich: Sweet
02/10/2017, 21:40:31: Rich: Yeah we were thinking that afterwards
03/10/2017, 09:51:05: Alex Brown: All pointing at you and laughing rich
03/10/2017, 09:51:21: Alex Brown: Cider needs to go in the cold around now bro
03/10/2017, 09:51:50: Alex Brown: Hows it looking?
03/10/2017, 09:52:01: Alex Brown: Any still active?
03/10/2017, 09:52:03: Rich: It needs to be racked first
03/10/2017, 09:52:12: Rich: And it needs to stay warm for secondary fermentation
03/10/2017, 09:52:17: Rich: It's all still bubbling
03/10/2017, 09:52:17: Alex Brown: Take a picture
03/10/2017, 09:52:22: Rich: Weston is very slow
03/10/2017, 09:52:30: Alex Brown: Ok faor
03/10/2017, 09:52:38: Rich: Weston and bob west are starting to clear
03/10/2017, 09:52:40: Alex Brown: Lets have a ganders
03/10/2017, 09:52:44: Rich: Sorry west Heath
03/10/2017, 09:52:51: Rich: Bob west is opaque
03/10/2017, 09:52:56: Rich: I'm at the office
03/10/2017, 09:52:57: Alex Brown: Drop them in the cold then
03/10/2017, 09:53:06: Alex Brown: If theyre clearing
03/10/2017, 09:53:09: Rich: Nope they need to keep fermenting
03/10/2017, 09:53:18: Rich: And we should rack them first anyway
03/10/2017, 09:53:31: Rich: Also adding finings at that point
03/10/2017, 09:53:37: Alex Brown: They will keep fermenting rich
03/10/2017, 09:53:42: Alex Brown: No
03/10/2017, 09:53:54: Alex Brown: Add finings before the final rack
03/10/2017, 09:54:08: Alex Brown: You dont add them 3 weeks before
03/10/2017, 09:54:25: Alex Brown: They work within 24 hours
03/10/2017, 09:54:40: Alex Brown: The pick up what the cold doesnt clear
03/10/2017, 11:14:38: Rich: I think you're confused
03/10/2017, 11:14:51: Rich: Either you want it to ferment and improve the flavour or you want it to clear
03/10/2017, 11:15:06: Rich: If you want it to ferment it should be warm
03/10/2017, 11:15:16: Rich: If you want it to clear it should be cold and contain fininga
03/10/2017, 11:15:45: Rich: Making it cold without finings is neither the best way to make it ferment nor the best way to clear it
03/10/2017, 11:16:52: Alex Brown: Cold settles the majority rich
03/10/2017, 11:17:14: Alex Brown: Finings pick up the finer particles that dont
03/10/2017, 11:17:30: Rich: I'm going to leave it in the warm
03/10/2017, 11:19:39: Rich: actually a lot of people online recommend not using finings at all
03/10/2017, 11:20:34: Rich: I think because we put the pectolase in early it should just clear on its own
03/10/2017, 11:20:54: Rich: I still think it needs more time in the warm and that we should rack it before we move it downstairs
03/10/2017, 11:27:27: Alex Brown: Rich i think doing thing with you csn be frustrating as fuck
03/10/2017, 11:27:43: Alex Brown: Weve done this for 4 years
03/10/2017, 11:27:53: Alex Brown: Put it in the cold
03/10/2017, 11:28:06: Alex Brown: And stop messing with it
03/10/2017, 11:28:50: Rich: http://www.wyeastlab.com/fermentation

Secondary fermentation in beer occurs at the same temperature as primary
03/10/2017, 11:29:11: Rich: Primary fermentation was still occurring in most barrels because the sugar content was too high
03/10/2017, 11:29:34: Rich: The Weston specific gravity was quite low so I may put that one in the cold sooner rather than later
03/10/2017, 11:30:02: Rich: but I'd rather rack them first if we're going to rack them as otherwise we'll just shake up the yeast putting them downstairs and upstairs again
03/10/2017, 11:30:48: Rich: I'm literally just going from guides online
03/10/2017, 11:54:25: Rich: People do say it's best brewed at like 16C all the way, but under 10 and it'll stop fermenting, so I will move it away from the radiator but it's definitely too early to put it in the basement
03/10/2017, 12:17:48: Alex Brown: We dont want it super strong tho
03/10/2017, 12:17:49: Alex Brown: One was at 6%
03/10/2017, 12:29:27: Rich: From what I've read it's going to ferment all the sugar either way
03/10/2017, 12:29:43: Rich: And why not make it strong? ;)
03/10/2017, 12:30:07: Rich: I'll show you some photos tonight, but I definitely think we want to wait a bit longer
03/10/2017, 13:18:49: Rich: https://i.imgur.com/ZYYQ1TG.gif
03/10/2017, 13:29:44: James: Omg that knee is ruthless
03/10/2017, 13:30:15: James: It's he's been hit with an anvil.....
03/10/2017, 13:30:34: James: *like
04/10/2017, 09:33:02: James: Did 2h beginner's climbing course at mile end last night.
04/10/2017, 09:33:17: James: Really good fun
04/10/2017, 09:36:25: sil: you should just come with me and rich. we go every week!
04/10/2017, 09:36:25: sil: screw courses
04/10/2017, 09:42:54: Rich: To be fair it wouldn't hurt to do some lessons. I'm sure there's a lot of basic mistakes we make
04/10/2017, 09:43:47: James: Can you belay?
04/10/2017, 09:45:39: Rich: Nope but rope climbing is lame
04/10/2017, 09:45:46: Rich: Bouldering is where it's at
04/10/2017, 09:46:54: sil: we've belayed rich. it's not hard.
but yeah. bouldering is more fun and technical
04/10/2017, 09:47:56: James: Both are good, neither is really more technical - depends on the route you're doing
04/10/2017, 09:48:04: Alex Brown: You guy boulder
04/10/2017, 09:48:10: James: Rope is definitely easier
04/10/2017, 09:48:21: Alex Brown: I thought u went lame rock climbing
04/10/2017, 09:49:30: sil: you wouldn't know. you never come with us
04/10/2017, 09:50:47: James: I'm up for bouldering in a few weeks once course is done
04/10/2017, 09:51:16: James: You get more bang for your buck
04/10/2017, 09:51:47: James: And work out is more intense
04/10/2017, 09:51:58: Rich: I'd be up for belay at some point
04/10/2017, 09:52:11: Rich: But bouldering is a lot more quick and intense
04/10/2017, 09:52:33: James: I'm going to look for a bouldering course too - need proper tuition on technique to get most out of it
04/10/2017, 09:53:02: James: Do you have your own shoes?
04/10/2017, 09:53:10: Rich: You don't need good technique to get a good workout
04/10/2017, 09:53:12: Rich: Nah not yet
04/10/2017, 09:53:19: Rich: I really should get some
04/10/2017, 09:53:37: James: No one said that
04/10/2017, 09:53:45: Rich: But they're like 100 to buy and 2.50 to rent so it takes 40 sessions to get your money's worth
04/10/2017, 09:54:40: James: Probs best to learn in rentals rather than rely on good shoes to begin with
04/10/2017, 09:55:16: James: Saw a guy bouldering bare foot yesterday.... 😑
04/10/2017, 09:58:52: James: I meant in terms of skills progression
04/10/2017, 09:59:31: Rich: I meant in terms of man progression
04/10/2017, 09:59:31: James: Don't want to waste time unlearning bad habits
04/10/2017, 10:01:09: James: 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
04/10/2017, 10:09:33: Rich: While you're fannying around with "technique" we'll be powering up the walls with our super muscles!!!!
04/10/2017, 10:10:26: Rich: 💪🏻
04/10/2017, 10:10:56: James: Inefficiently, training the wrong muscles
04/10/2017, 10:11:33: Rich: .
04/10/2017, 10:12:57: James: And weakening to the point you can go no further, merely clinging on for dear life as I race past like spiderman on speed
04/10/2017, 10:13:41: James: 🕷🕷🕷
04/10/2017, 10:13:54: James: 💊💊💊
04/10/2017, 14:11:11: James: <‎image omitted>

04/10/2017, 14:19:49: James: Niiice didn't know you were friends with those guys and girl, see you all tomorrow night!
04/10/2017, 14:22:05: James: I'll bring some houmous along with a strong sense of superiority over the general masses
04/10/2017, 14:22:40: James: Those sheeple....
04/10/2017, 14:25:10: James: Only joking btw, only having a light-hearted dig
04/10/2017, 14:25:30: sil: oh woah hold your horses.

04/10/2017, 14:25:49: James: ......go on.
04/10/2017, 14:26:00: sil: you will have to study the teachers and prove your willingness to devote yiurself to humanism
04/10/2017, 14:27:03: James: Sounds.....
04/10/2017, 14:27:07: James: .......gay.
04/10/2017, 14:28:09: James: I thought anyone could be humanist.. all these rules sounds a little dogmatic
04/10/2017, 14:29:00: sil: yes of course you can.
if you score over 70 on the test
04/10/2017, 14:29:44: James: I am scored 100%?
04/10/2017, 14:30:55: sil: I've got to say james.
a 100% score is quite unusual.
it's been foretold in the writings of Dawkins, that he who scores 100% on the humanist compatibility test is he who will lead our people to the sacred spring of knowledge
04/10/2017, 14:32:18: James: Wetherspoons?
04/10/2017, 14:32:44: sil: the spring being a glorious water fountakn of truth and science, where all facts flow free.
however there are those who believe the spring isn't a physical thing. but they are wrong. and will be punnished.
04/10/2017, 14:32:50: James: No that's cheap alcohol. You said knowledge. Sorry
04/10/2017, 14:33:29: James: Oh no does sound like Wetherspoons after all
04/10/2017, 14:33:43: sil: basically is
04/10/2017, 14:34:20: James: Reach out and sup faith!!
04/10/2017, 14:48:46: sil: May Darwin be in your heart
04/10/2017, 14:50:11: James: Darwin for Dawkins?
04/10/2017, 14:50:19: James: *or
04/10/2017, 15:10:43: sil: we humanists say that Dawkins and Darwin are like 2 lenses of the same microscope. we take this from the story of Gale, which we tell every year ok Double D day. our most atheist day of the year.
but I shan't bore you with the tale today
04/10/2017, 17:43:25: James: What's your plan for Friday then?
04/10/2017, 17:43:25: James: How does one celebrate a humanist birthday?
04/10/2017, 17:46:04: James: Will there be a church-shaped piñata stuffed with cards printed with rational observations of the world around us?
04/10/2017, 18:04:13: sil: yes. you have studied our culture I see
04/10/2017, 18:04:45: sil: going to a pub called the hemingford arms on Friday if your free and up for it
04/10/2017, 18:09:09: James: We're celebrating our engagement with a family meal on Friday, but would be nice to join after. Where is the hemmingford?
04/10/2017, 18:09:53: sil: yeah i thought you were. it's near Caledonian road
04/10/2017, 18:11:01: James: Ok cool, we could probably make it there by 10, bit late but assume you'll be there until kicking out time?
04/10/2017, 18:38:00: sil: yeah i imagine we will!
05/10/2017, 09:45:26: sil: @447792421618 I was chatting with a couple of the Humi lads down at the community Laboratory last night, after Wednesday chants, and we've decided to give you a shot at becoming our rationally observational messiah. that really was an outstanding score you achieved. Ricky Gervais was fuming. he's only a 77%.
05/10/2017, 09:48:26: sil: he will never reach the eternal evolutionary state with such low Humi-levels
05/10/2017, 09:57:11: James: Sweet. I'll pick up a long white (lab) coat this evening. I can then prepare a hypothesis and suitable test methodology for leading the Humanist Brotherhood into the future. Where we will find exactly what is there. And nothing more.
05/10/2017, 10:02:58: sil: perfect. oh also, in our culture we don't eat Nuts. don't know why but if you do, technically, you will be forced to de-evolve. but it's not so strictly enforced nowadays. but still, no nuts.
05/10/2017, 10:08:41: James: What about legumes, do they comply with the rationalist equivalent of kosher?
05/10/2017, 10:14:03: sil: haha kosher; what an absurd regressive concept. 
surely legumes are closer to beans and pulses?
05/10/2017, 10:21:12: James: I cannot say without making a minor assumption and that would count as faith, hence I will say nothing and wait until a scientist is here to advise me via the undertaking of reasoned analysis.
05/10/2017, 10:24:04: James: So sayeth humanist.co.uk. Although it may hold 'pages' and 'written text', it is _not_ a book.
05/10/2017, 10:24:12: James: Books are bad
05/10/2017, 10:25:33: sil: you are wise beyond your life cycle James.
05/10/2017, 17:31:16: Rich: <‎image omitted>
05/10/2017, 17:32:05: sil: it's beautiful 😭
05/10/2017, 17:32:27: Rich: I might go buy an anorak in celebration
05/10/2017, 17:32:30: sil: I bet you can't wait to only ever use that card to cut up lines
05/10/2017, 17:33:36: sil: that's nice. they've given us over a year
05/10/2017, 17:33:53: sil: expires end of 2018 instead of October
05/10/2017, 17:34:18: Rich: I hope you mean lines of hops
05/10/2017, 17:34:32: Rich: There's actually a beer festival in Nottingham soon
05/10/2017, 17:35:23: sil: by cut up lines, I mean use it to get to the front of queues at beer fests!
"member coming move out the way!"
05/10/2017, 17:36:03: sil: bit of a mission away
05/10/2017, 17:42:47: James: Nice. Now when people ask why you smell of alcohol and haven't shaved you can show them that card and they'll question you no more.
05/10/2017, 17:43:47: James: Will probably get you out of a bind with the constabulary too should they ever mistake you for a homeless.
05/10/2017, 17:44:08: James: Camra is a bit like the Masons in that regard
05/10/2017, 18:31:07: James: <‎image omitted>
05/10/2017, 18:31:38: James: I'm well jel you will be receiving this fine publication quarterly..

05/10/2017, 18:35:12: sil: a war is coming James. who's side will you be on?
05/10/2017, 18:36:52: James: The side that's least likely to expire from old age before it's finished

05/10/2017, 21:51:05: Rich: It's not hard to foresee with East London existing and James being your friend
05/10/2017, 22:07:15: Alex Brown: Not a shoddy job, working around poor architects layouts
05/10/2017, 22:07:32: Alex Brown: It works fine
05/10/2017, 22:09:22: James: Hah - he told me
05/10/2017, 22:10:07: sil: haha oh I see.
ok then. ball pit it is!
05/10/2017, 22:12:44: James: Irrational! irrational! I'm telling Stephen

05/10/2017, 22:19:59: James: I think Joshua may run a rival ballpit...
05/10/2017, 22:21:26: James: Ulrike definitely are angry and his friends should steer clear also!
05/10/2017, 22:22:05: James: Ball bag club has big problemy...

05/10/2017, 22:26:32: James: Trouble at the ranch tonight...
05/10/2017, 22:27:04: James: Apparently coming to the pub after Benton dinner is heavily frowned upon
05/10/2017, 22:27:49: James: Some sort of faux pas
05/10/2017, 22:29:04: sil: have they crucified Alex to set an example?
05/10/2017, 22:29:25: James: Alex is currently on trial for high treason
05/10/2017, 22:29:57: James: I believe his punishment may be eeked out for some time yet. Crucifixion would be too easy
05/10/2017, 22:30:28: sil: poor man. his only crime is being a good friend
05/10/2017, 22:31:28: James: Are you going straight to hemmingford after work?
05/10/2017, 22:32:42: sil: I guess so
05/10/2017, 22:32:58: sil: it's kinda on way home if I get off 2 stops early
05/10/2017, 22:33:09: James: Whilst simultaneously being a bad flatmate, boyfriend and future son-in-law. Bit of a catch 22.
05/10/2017, 22:33:29: James: Where do work again?
05/10/2017, 22:34:05: sil: North Acton, but I take the over ground west to east from wilsden junction
05/10/2017, 22:36:39: sil: so many people ive invited seem to be busy tomorrow. I need Alex to bulk up the numbers
06/10/2017, 08:01:48: Alex Brown: Jelous
06/10/2017, 08:02:18: Alex Brown: It that a pitbull
06/10/2017, 08:05:09: sil: ball pit pit bull
06/10/2017, 08:07:35: Alex Brown: Just because its your birthday doesnt mean you can reackage my jokes
06/10/2017, 08:07:38: Alex Brown: Not bants
06/10/2017, 08:07:55: Alex Brown: Repackage
06/10/2017, 08:08:33: sil: you just made an observation. I made the word play
06/10/2017, 08:10:07: Alex Brown: It was supposed to be word play
06/10/2017, 08:10:15: Alex Brown: Not observation
06/10/2017, 08:10:34: Alex Brown: It may well be a pit bull
06/10/2017, 08:10:55: Alex Brown: But its probably a french bull dog

06/10/2017, 08:40:19: Rich: I'm not sure that that's a pure cantilever
06/10/2017, 08:40:56: sil: it does have a metal structure beneath. but I don't reckon it's structural
06/10/2017, 08:42:02: Rich: I reckon it is. But i guess a lot of the force holding up that part of the building is from a cantilever
06/10/2017, 08:42:16: sil: I don't think it is
06/10/2017, 08:42:51: sil: if you can see the bottom it crosses and grounds on a terrace thing
06/10/2017, 08:43:25: sil: but let the structural engineer here decide
06/10/2017, 08:55:15: Alex Brown: It is a cantilever but the design is so bad it needs steel cross bracing for stabilise it against wind
06/10/2017, 08:55:15: Alex Brown: Which kind of defeats the point in spending ridiculous amounts of money in making it do that
06/10/2017, 09:04:12: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
06/10/2017, 09:22:48: Rich: Ah so it's at that angle because it's under tension rather than compression
06/10/2017, 09:51:46: James: House Bolton
06/10/2017, 09:51:53: James: 🤓
06/10/2017, 09:52:27: Rich: You're the only person in this chat that is both a structural engineer and a GoT fan
06/10/2017, 09:53:01: sil: James a structural engineer now....
06/10/2017, 09:53:19: James: Structural engineer? I'm a brick-counter..
06/10/2017, 09:53:22: Rich: Oops I mean involved in that industry in some concise wording
06/10/2017, 09:53:35: sil: that's racist rich
06/10/2017, 09:53:48: sil: all jobs in that industry look the same to you?
06/10/2017, 09:53:51: Rich: James' job sounds so boring I actually forget what it is most of the time
06/10/2017, 09:53:54: Rich: They do
06/10/2017, 09:54:23: sil: James does a great job.
and he will bring up cool kids who are really awesome
06/10/2017, 09:54:31: sil: cause that's what people in that line of work do
06/10/2017, 09:55:53: Rich: I hate to tell you but Alex's dad was an engineer...

06/10/2017, 15:25:27: sil: hey James, why not cancel your dull, family, be polite to your finances parents dinner party, and celebrate your engagement as a footnote to my birthday?
06/10/2017, 15:40:59: Rich: Oh that's what's happening?
06/10/2017, 15:41:07: Rich: What a lamo
06/10/2017, 15:41:16: Rich: Getting married instead of coming to the pub
06/10/2017, 15:41:28: Rich: This is why he's not allowed in CAMRA
06/10/2017, 15:43:14: James: Yes I had gathered that Camra was a make only entity
06/10/2017, 15:44:35: James: More like a strong scrumpy I'd say
06/10/2017, 15:45:25: James: The sort that used to be paid as wages, hence the name
06/10/2017, 15:46:03: James: @447590993190 what time you getting to pub?
06/10/2017, 15:46:31: James: And are you doing anything after?
06/10/2017, 15:47:08: sil: will probably just stay around that pub.
they have a good folk band that play from 9
06/10/2017, 15:48:36: sil: why not being Carries parents. I imagine they'd prefer to celebrate my birthday than some one snatching their favourite daughter
06/10/2017, 15:55:49: James: ?
06/10/2017, 15:58:42: sil: around 7.

06/10/2017, 17:00:05: James: I still don't quite understand why you bought that pi, why don't you just attach your phone to the TV with or without wires?
06/10/2017, 17:02:02: sil: good point
06/10/2017, 17:02:04: James: If I understand correctly your main goal is to lie on your back and do the absolute bare minimum to be able to cue av streams and then lie motionless as you receive them
06/10/2017, 17:02:15: sil: you could just mirror yi ur phone
06/10/2017, 17:02:30: James: Surely your existing phone is the most efficient way of achieving this?
06/10/2017, 17:03:16: sil: this is why James is the chosen one in our culture. this level of rational logic.

09/10/2017, 12:11:12: sil: cycle trip to Prague via Belgium and Germany?
09/10/2017, 12:11:22: sil: how many weeks would that take?
09/10/2017, 12:11:30: Rich: That's quite a way
09/10/2017, 12:11:35: Rich: Would be awesome
09/10/2017, 12:13:06: sil: you would hit a few of those if you want Amsterdam, Belgium, Munich then prague.
although I realise the distances between the last 3 are pretty hygeb
09/10/2017, 12:13:27: Rich: It's like 1000km
09/10/2017, 12:13:45: Rich: We've ridden less than 200km on previous trips
09/10/2017, 12:14:05: Rich: Although the Belgian part would be pretty flat
09/10/2017, 12:14:21: sil: it's be a week+
09/10/2017, 12:14:32: Rich: We'd be better off doing a loop
09/10/2017, 12:14:43: Rich: I reckon we could do 50km a day
09/10/2017, 12:14:57: Rich: So in a week 400km would be pushing it
09/10/2017, 12:15:17: Rich: Cycling from Belgium into German would be doable
09/10/2017, 12:15:20: sil: I'm sure all our girlfriends would be over the moon if we tool 2 weeks holiday for a beer cycle trip
09/10/2017, 12:15:24: Rich: Maybe with some holand
09/10/2017, 12:15:28: Rich: Ha
09/10/2017, 12:16:33: sil: we could do a Netherlands/Belgium loop in a week I reckon
09/10/2017, 12:16:41: Rich: we could do something like this:

09/10/2017, 12:17:08: Rich: there's like a third of the amount of climbing compared to Southwold so maybe we could be more ambitious

09/10/2017, 12:18:15: sil: then we can get ferry back
09/10/2017, 12:18:19: sil: easi3 for bike

09/10/2017, 12:19:24: sil: and wiggle through all the best Belgium beer cities
09/10/2017, 12:19:47: sil: and maybe try and nip into Germany
09/10/2017, 12:20:03: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 12:20:45: sil: that's a good route I reckon.
09/10/2017, 12:20:53: James: Would definitely be up for ending in 'dam. That would be awesome
09/10/2017, 12:21:01: sil: but include Ghent
09/10/2017, 12:21:18: sil: NO weed tho.
you guys have to promise
09/10/2017, 12:21:22: Rich: Yeah that'd be cool
09/10/2017, 12:21:31: Rich: We promise LOL
09/10/2017, 12:21:30: sil: NO icky week
09/10/2017, 12:21:33: sil: weed
09/10/2017, 12:21:53: Rich: Might be easier to skip Germany
09/10/2017, 12:22:11: Rich: Although the Netherlands countryside could get pretty dull after a while if we stay coastal
09/10/2017, 12:22:21: Rich: It's ffffflllllaaaaaattttt
09/10/2017, 12:22:32: sil: think it'd be nice to go Germany.
but maybe not worth the effort. No great border cities on the western side
09/10/2017, 12:22:55: sil: as they all got destroyed ww2
09/10/2017, 12:24:13: sil: from what I remember all the town around the western German border are all boring, lifeless new towns
09/10/2017, 12:25:03: Rich: Yeah I've never seen much there
09/10/2017, 12:25:11: Rich: Hamburg is nice but that's a bit out of reach
09/10/2017, 12:25:53: Rich: I'd like to see some of the islands in the south of holland
09/10/2017, 12:27:06: sil: think it'd be nicer to go via Belgium. arnt those islands just flat flood planes basically
09/10/2017, 12:27:10: sil: boring flats
09/10/2017, 12:27:54: Rich: Possibly
09/10/2017, 12:28:15: Rich: I think it's on some of those islands that they speak the closest living language to English
09/10/2017, 12:28:56: sil: Calais - Bruge - Ghent - Antwerp - rotterdam - Amsterdam
09/10/2017, 12:29:12: sil: would be ideal i think
09/10/2017, 12:30:04: Rich: Yeah that sounds nice
09/10/2017, 12:30:07: sil: could swap out rotterdam for the hauge
09/10/2017, 12:30:25: Rich: Rotterdam is better but The Hague would be more en route I guess
09/10/2017, 12:30:35: Rich: We can make it a farewell to Europe trip
09/10/2017, 12:31:13: sil: ha yeah. let's cycle in union jacks
09/10/2017, 12:32:36: Rich: I hope you mean European Union jackets
09/10/2017, 12:33:19: sil: we can wear both
09/10/2017, 12:58:55: James: Deal. Can I also paint a St George's Cross on my face?
09/10/2017, 13:26:43: Alex Brown: I paint fuck french on my forehead?
09/10/2017, 13:27:22: sil: we won't be stopping in france
09/10/2017, 13:27:26: sil: we cycle through it
09/10/2017, 13:27:45: Alex Brown: Yeh lets stop and trow snails around
09/10/2017, 13:27:55: Alex Brown: Like top lads
09/10/2017, 13:28:12: sil: France isn't a good place
09/10/2017, 13:31:35: James: Can we at least skirt around it so we can deliver our streams of righteousness over the border and onto French soil?
09/10/2017, 13:32:01: James: 🇽🇪🇽🇪🇽🇪
09/10/2017, 13:32:18: sil: it's not worth it.
don't really want to risk coming into contact with a French speaker
09/10/2017, 13:33:31: Alex Brown: Belgian is pretty similar
09/10/2017, 13:34:37: Alex Brown: In the way that its french
09/10/2017, 13:36:29: sil: true.
we should stay on our guard. it's hard to tell which ones are French around there
09/10/2017, 13:36:59: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 13:37:02: sil: take blood tests from anyone you shake hands with. we will test the samples for impurity
09/10/2017, 13:37:05: Alex Brown: Oi oi camra lads

09/10/2017, 13:38:26: Alex Brown: Ladds
09/10/2017, 13:38:39: sil: Twickenham beer fest is way closer
09/10/2017, 13:39:00: Alex Brown: Its on a thursday
09/10/2017, 13:39:06: Alex Brown: Who does that
09/10/2017, 13:39:20: sil: camra lads on the dole
09/10/2017, 13:40:43: Alex Brown: Maidenhead
09/10/2017, 13:40:44: sil: respect to our lads who give their lives to drink in the mid week.
09/10/2017, 13:41:09: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 13:41:29: Alex Brown: We can go friday
09/10/2017, 13:41:39: Alex Brown: And maiden head is close
09/10/2017, 13:42:13: Alex Brown: Free pint
09/10/2017, 13:43:05: sil: next year we can plan a bike trip around beer festivals
09/10/2017, 13:43:14: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 13:44:23: James: That would be so great
09/10/2017, 13:46:00: sil: indeed.
if we can find 2 beer fests on the same weekend to travel between we'd be sorted
09/10/2017, 13:49:27: James: Nah just use your nose
09/10/2017, 13:49:33: James: 🇽🇪🇽🇪🇽🇪
09/10/2017, 13:50:12: sil: good thinking. you will smell soft cheese and arrogance if the person in question is a French
09/10/2017, 14:00:21: sil: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:00:34: James: And mustard if they are German
09/10/2017, 14:01:00: sil: i imagine its a subscription. gonna actually get the free box then cancel straight away.
09/10/2017, 14:01:16: James: Those beers look disgusting
09/10/2017, 14:03:00: sil: I'll be the judge of what my *free* beers taste like thank you, Mr James public, *non* camra member
09/10/2017, 14:04:02: Rich: £6 delivery then subscription to cancel
09/10/2017, 14:04:07: Rich: Might be just about worth it
09/10/2017, 14:04:40: sil: I havnt clicked through. so how much would it be then if u cancel right away?
09/10/2017, 14:05:37: Rich: £6
09/10/2017, 14:05:48: sil: hmm not bad
09/10/2017, 14:05:53: Rich: Yeah
09/10/2017, 14:05:59: Rich: It's stupidly expensive at full price
09/10/2017, 14:06:02: Rich: £3 a beer
09/10/2017, 14:06:13: sil: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:06:37: sil: has tits on the can
09/10/2017, 14:06:43: Rich: I didn't think you liked wheat beer
09/10/2017, 14:07:03: sil: I like tit beer
09/10/2017, 14:07:33: James: Looks fishy...
09/10/2017, 14:10:39: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:13:13: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:13:23: Rich: A light IPA is a complete contradiction
09/10/2017, 14:13:32: Rich: Much like that mild that was clearly a porter
09/10/2017, 14:13:38: Rich: People in the beer world are on crack
09/10/2017, 14:15:10: James: Overruled. By Camra. You need to fall in line.
09/10/2017, 14:15:33: Rich: I don't think the bar men were necessarily experts
09/10/2017, 14:15:52: James: It was in the printed literature
09/10/2017, 14:15:54: Rich: The cider guy's experience amounted to accidentally brewing cider in coke bottles
09/10/2017, 14:15:59: Rich: Pfft
09/10/2017, 14:17:35: James: You've been a member for a fortnight and you're already attempting to rewrite the holy scripture..
09/10/2017, 14:18:26: James: @447590993190 👢 @447858386777
09/10/2017, 14:18:36: sil: maybe you just don't know as much as you think
09/10/2017, 14:19:25: Rich: I think if I ordered a mild and got a porter I'd be upset
09/10/2017, 14:20:52: sil: don't think you really know the varients of beer very well
09/10/2017, 14:21:04: Rich: I guess not
09/10/2017, 14:21:13: sil: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:21:14: Rich: But I know what I usually get when I order a mild
09/10/2017, 14:21:26: Rich: Yeah that's my definition
09/10/2017, 14:21:31: Rich: I guess it doesn't exclude porter
09/10/2017, 14:21:46: Rich: But it's very rare to not call a dark black beer a porter
09/10/2017, 14:21:58: sil: you are going by colour like someone who knows nothing about cars saying "I don't like red ones"
09/10/2017, 14:22:15: sil: that mild you had didn t taste like a porter
09/10/2017, 14:22:39: Rich: I think colour is a fairly common way of classifying beers
09/10/2017, 14:22:46: Rich: It was james wasn't it?
09/10/2017, 14:22:58: Rich: Yeah it was quite light but still tasted a bit like one
09/10/2017, 14:23:22: sil: only cause your a noob and your eyes confused u cus it was dark coloured
09/10/2017, 14:23:32: sil: racist beer drinker
09/10/2017, 14:23:50: Rich: I just don't drink no paki beer
09/10/2017, 14:24:02: sil: fair enough
09/10/2017, 14:24:30: Rich: Yesterday a man was walking up Walthamstow high street yelling to his wife and kids about how some "East Indian" guy was a prick and that he'd stab him in the neck and that it should be "white British right of way"
09/10/2017, 14:35:51: James: It's ok Sil, those following the scientific method tend to exist in paradigms until the evidence supporting the next paradigm is so overwhelming the proponents are forced to make an embarrassing climbdown and reluctantly concede that they were wrong before proceeding to join the new world order.
09/10/2017, 14:37:28: James: http://www.camra.org.uk/mild
09/10/2017, 14:39:10: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:39:32: Rich: Huh fair enough
09/10/2017, 14:39:47: Rich: Bathams mild isn't that dark
09/10/2017, 14:40:36: sil: use your tastebuds rich
09/10/2017, 14:40:51: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 14:41:22: Rich: Interesting
09/10/2017, 14:41:41: sil: great use of research and evidence James. that's why your a humanist
09/10/2017, 14:53:43: sil: anyone watch the new Louis Theroux?
09/10/2017, 15:02:57: Rich: Not yet
09/10/2017, 15:03:00: Rich: It sounds good
09/10/2017, 15:10:04: sil: yeah it was good.
pretty bleak, but good. interesting characters
09/10/2017, 15:10:36: Rich: Cool. It's about opiates right? And there's some new prescription one that's super addictive?
09/10/2017, 15:10:49: sil: it's mostly about heroin
09/10/2017, 15:11:06: sil: but nearly all those people have got there via persceiption opiates
09/10/2017, 15:11:17: sil: which is a massive problem on America
09/10/2017, 15:11:30: Rich: Interesting
09/10/2017, 15:11:35: Rich: I'll probs watch it tonight

09/10/2017, 15:19:58: Alex Brown: I need new free boots
09/10/2017, 15:29:12: sil: that part of the conversation was so long ago
09/10/2017, 15:30:06: sil: keep up
09/10/2017, 17:45:44: Alex Brown: Damn theyve been snapped up

09/10/2017, 17:48:30: James: You should have asked?
09/10/2017, 17:48:58: James: In a more timely manner
09/10/2017, 17:49:07: sil: why you at mansion house?
09/10/2017, 17:49:11: sil: that's near me
09/10/2017, 17:49:29: James: Looking for free shoes
09/10/2017, 17:49:38: sil: oh no I'm thinking manor house
09/10/2017, 17:49:55: Alex Brown: Yes
09/10/2017, 17:50:04: Alex Brown: I got confused at first
09/10/2017, 17:50:45: Alex Brown: James always pick up nee boots
09/10/2017, 17:50:57: Alex Brown: New not knee
09/10/2017, 17:51:15: sil: Alex only likes knee high boots
09/10/2017, 17:51:22: Alex Brown: Youll look like you murder prostitutes if you pick up knee boots
09/10/2017, 17:52:15: Alex Brown: Im waiting James
09/10/2017, 17:52:23: Alex Brown: This is over 2 mins
09/10/2017, 17:52:56: James: Replying has slowed me down
09/10/2017, 17:53:24: Alex Brown: I have porn now
09/10/2017, 17:53:30: Alex Brown: Time must not be wasted
09/10/2017, 18:43:48: James: <‎image omitted>
09/10/2017, 18:47:25: Alex Brown: Hes a very ruddy faced man isnt he
09/10/2017, 18:47:42: James: The controversial beer in question... the Oscar Wilde. Or maybe it should be renamed as a Janet Street-Porter @447858386777?
09/10/2017, 18:48:06: James: That is a serious Tory pub right there...
09/10/2017, 18:49:58: sil: tory pubs have the best beer
09/10/2017, 18:51:03: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>

09/10/2017, 18:51:49: James: Conservative with the budget and the hops... Jolly good chaps all round!
09/10/2017, 18:51:55: Alex Brown: Actually the majority of those beers are shit
09/10/2017, 18:52:56: sil: who is the greater arrogant authority on beer. you or rich?
09/10/2017, 18:53:14: James: From you @447753461116, that comes as a real surprise....
09/10/2017, 18:53:32: James: NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE!
09/10/2017, 18:53:56: sil: @447753461116 is just negative about everything. is there  nothing you like?
09/10/2017, 18:54:05: James: 🙎🏼‍♂

09/10/2017, 19:07:33: Alex Brown: Im on episode 10 of westworld now and i dont feel like anything has become confusing or hard to follow
09/10/2017, 19:08:03: Rich: 👏
09/10/2017, 19:33:53: sil: arnt you a super clever little trooper
09/10/2017, 19:35:08: sil: episode 10 is the finally. I think you should know what's going on by now
09/10/2017, 21:27:03: sil: did you watch louis theroux rich?
09/10/2017, 21:28:03: Rich: Yeah it's really depressing
09/10/2017, 21:28:16: Rich: Good though
09/10/2017, 21:36:33: sil: yeah. I dunno how Louis remains so chill in those situations
09/10/2017, 21:37:31: sil: just casually chatting with people injecting heroin
09/10/2017, 21:41:14: sil: not phased by chatting with rough looking drug dealers. he's the coolest nerd
09/10/2017, 21:43:08: James: He's -273 degrees celcius cool
09/10/2017, 21:43:18: James: 🤓
09/10/2017, 22:16:26: Rich: That's impossible james!
09/10/2017, 22:16:39: Rich: But yeah it's pretty amazing
09/10/2017, 22:17:15: Rich: I've not really seen that much heroin abuse before
09/10/2017, 22:18:11: sil: yeah. it's cool they show it without being judgemental
09/10/2017, 22:18:34: sil: mostly Louis let's them get on with it without criticising
09/10/2017, 22:18:43: Rich: Yeah. It also really goes into the route causes and shows how these are basically normal people that got a shit deal
09/10/2017, 22:18:56: Rich: You feel like he wants to help but won't intervene ignorantly
09/10/2017, 22:19:34: sil: I thought the guy who was living in a tent and resigned to being high all the time was pretty sad

09/10/2017, 22:20:45: sil: but feel even more sorry for the young girl who obviously slept with him for heroin!

09/10/2017, 22:36:06: Rich: It seemed like he was deluding himself, but I guess the thing with heroin is that you don't really care about the negatives so long as you're high
09/10/2017, 22:36:10: Rich: Looks like fun anyway
09/10/2017, 22:36:32: Rich: That girl was far too sophisticated looking for a heroin addict
09/10/2017, 22:37:04: sil: yeah. I guess seeming as he was dealing a bit he maintained enough money to stay high all the time off a supply.
09/10/2017, 22:37:17: sil: I know. sad. she had a nice bag
09/10/2017, 22:37:29: sil: wont last long

10/10/2017, 09:12:10: James: Are the cans small, pretentious and garish?

looking for a cheap place to go for a weekend thing .
is it just stag dos  and nothing else of worth?
10/10/2017, 11:07:49: James: Prague is pretty cool, pretty cold around this time of year.
10/10/2017, 11:08:34: James: Did a stag do there which mainly revolved around drinking so didn't see too much of the locale
10/10/2017, 11:08:42: James: Beer is cheap...
10/10/2017, 11:09:12: sil: yeah, my research shows it as being very cheap, hense the option

11/10/2017, 19:59:29: James: 1 ticket is left.
11/10/2017, 19:59:49: Rich: Definitely?

12/10/2017, 08:26:26: sil: all these things fly in the face of my firmly held beliefs.
12/10/2017, 08:27:22: sil: my entrenched humanist and anti ball pit convictions
12/10/2017, 09:33:18: sil: sure my dad thought ball pit bars were a stupid idea, and so did his daddy, but that doesn't make it any less FACT that ball pit bars for adults are a stupid novelty fad designed to part people with money in an overly competitive nightlife environment.
12/10/2017, 09:33:56: Rich: I'm afraid you'll have to commission a study to prove that
12/10/2017, 10:00:24: Alex Brown: Ball are gay
12/10/2017, 10:23:17: sil: that's your study right there
12/10/2017, 10:24:01: Rich: Well I don't think a sample size of 1 proves very much does it
12/10/2017, 10:28:05: James: Of course any such study is an exercise in futility as nothing can ever be proven.
12/10/2017, 10:33:17: sil: what even is proof?
12/10/2017, 10:36:16: Rich: Now we're nose diving through mathematics towards philosophy
12/10/2017, 10:41:37: James: And we didn't even stop-off to refuel in science
12/10/2017, 10:45:05: James: Evidence to support the  that something is definitely true
12/10/2017, 10:45:41: James: Evidence to support ~the~  that something is definitely true
12/10/2017, 10:45:56: Rich: Evidence or argument to demonstrate the validity of a statement
12/10/2017, 10:46:30: Rich: Inductive proof takes a set of what are considered to be true premises and demonstrates using logical rules truth of some further statement
12/10/2017, 10:46:35: Rich: Deductive*
12/10/2017, 10:47:25: Rich: Whilst inductive proof takes a large number of examples of something to demonstrate the validity of a statement
12/10/2017, 10:48:14: Rich: In particular a large number of examples of phenomenon B following phenomenon A may be used to demonstrate a causal relationship between A and B
12/10/2017, 10:48:57: James: Correlation! Correlation!
12/10/2017, 10:49:10: Rich: Scientific inductive proof requires the formulation of some theory by deduction and the derivation of some expectation from that theory which must then be demonstrated by induction
12/10/2017, 10:50:26: Rich: It is possible by examining multiple possible causal relations to derive a known causal relationship from experimentation and not merely knowledge of some correlation
12/10/2017, 10:50:58: James: Naturally.
12/10/2017, 10:50:59: Rich: Unless you're Hume, in which case nothing being correlated ever actually proves a relationship
12/10/2017, 10:51:22: Rich: But I think all he really did was prove that scholasticism was a dead end
12/10/2017, 10:52:54: James: Thank not the heavens but ourselves that we don't squander are time on this planet trying to 'prove' things.
12/10/2017, 10:53:31: Rich: No you're right blind belief is a much better state in which to spend our time
12/10/2017, 10:53:31: sil: proof is just a word.
it's humans that give it meaning. just THINK about it
12/10/2017, 10:53:42: Rich: ...
12/10/2017, 10:54:10: sil: sorry rich. knew that truth bomb would be too much for you to understand
12/10/2017, 10:54:30: Rich: .
12/10/2017, 10:54:52: sil: lul I've literally broken rich with some cognitive genius
12/10/2017, 10:55:03: Rich: ........!
12/10/2017, 10:56:00: sil: I'll explain.
proof is ACTUALLY just a word. that humans made up. therefore how can proof my fact when it's a made up word. therefore we all must be a lie. therefore more or less one can conclude that everything is a lie and there is no truth cause proof doesn't exist
12/10/2017, 10:56:25: sil: I'll take a moment for you to get your head round that. I imagine there are explosions in your brain right now
12/10/2017, 10:57:05: James: You are correct in saying that (unequivocal) proof does not exist.
12/10/2017, 10:57:25: James: Any good humanist knows that.
12/10/2017, 10:57:48: Rich: Blown away
12/10/2017, 10:58:29: Rich: You must be as smart as Jaden Smith
12/10/2017, 10:58:29: sil: yeah exactly. henceforth, to be concluded, as the data shows, proof is ACTUALLY just a sound that humans make. it's just air rearranged to make a sound which makes a word. visa vie, proof is not proof
12/10/2017, 10:59:10: Rich: It's amazing you know about air and it's relationship to sound in the absence of proof
12/10/2017, 10:59:09: James: Anyone got Tash's number, think Rich might be having a fit?
12/10/2017, 10:59:47: sil: moreover, it is evident to suggest that proof actually isn't even consistent across culture
12/10/2017, 10:59:59: sil: some culture have different words for proof
12/10/2017, 11:00:10: sil: so how can it be consistent and evident as fact??
12/10/2017, 11:00:32: sil: proof in Spanish is probably a totally different word. so NOT consistent
12/10/2017, 11:00:50: sil: rich do you need to sit down?
I know I've just rocked your world view

12/10/2017, 11:20:47: James: We should send help. But what number do you even call when a friend is in the midst of an existential crisis?
12/10/2017, 11:21:12: James: NHS Direct?
12/10/2017, 11:21:20: James: The Pope?
12/10/2017, 11:21:37: James: Deliveroo?
12/10/2017, 11:30:30: sil: no James. we don't believe he exists remember. were humanists
12/10/2017, 11:30:43: sil: there is no evidence for a so called "pope"
12/10/2017, 11:56:03: James: Respectfully I would have to disagree. Evidence, 'proof' if you will, indeed appears to exist to support the existence of 'The Pope'; however this is a moot point and is of little interest to Humanists (or to any others following the scientific method) as "The Pope" can never be proven.
12/10/2017, 12:51:58: James: @447753461116 @447858386777 Do you fancy coming to this folk night at the Ivy House this evening? If you're keen ask your respective partners too? Adam's coming, Kirsty tbc.

26/10/2017, 13:50:11: Alex Brown: Great pub
26/10/2017, 13:50:22: Alex Brown: Lots of oakhams and timmys
26/10/2017, 13:50:29: Alex Brown: And great thai food
26/10/2017, 13:50:48: sil: I'm going to York in 2 weeks. apparently some good pubs there
26/10/2017, 13:51:14: sil: apparently the building that guy fawkes was born in is a really nice pub
26/10/2017, 13:54:26: Alex Brown: Whats the significance, hes just a guy
26/10/2017, 13:54:49: sil: what's the significance of guy fawkes?
26/10/2017, 13:57:47: sil: he attempted a Catholic plot against protestant England. his downfall lead to heavy handed persecution of Catholics and strengthend our great protestant kingdom. separating us apart further from the European Catholic powers of the day and hardling our British identity. you could say, by guy fawkes not blowing up parliament and over throwing our protestant king, he caused brexit.
26/10/2017, 14:00:54: Rich: To be fair Germany is the most powerful European country and they basically started the whole Protestant thing...
26/10/2017, 14:01:56: sil: yeah. but the power base of Europe at the time was around west Europe. with Spain being the biggest player at the time
26/10/2017, 14:02:24: sil: infact guy fawkes faught for the Spanish in the 100 years war before he returned to England
26/10/2017, 14:02:45: sil: by west Europe I mean weat of German lands
26/10/2017, 14:02:54: Rich: Have you been watching that new drama with the guy from GoT?
26/10/2017, 14:02:59: sil: nope
26/10/2017, 14:03:01: sil: why?
26/10/2017, 14:03:30: Rich: Oh it’s about the guy Fawkes plot I think
26/10/2017, 14:03:36: sil: GOT is gay
26/10/2017, 14:04:10: sil: is the dwarf in it?
26/10/2017, 14:04:26: Rich: Sadly not
26/10/2017, 14:07:42: sil: it's funny how we burn a guy fawkes every year as a big fuck you to the Catholics of Europe
26/10/2017, 14:12:35: Rich: 🔥🖕
26/10/2017, 14:12:59: sil: post brexit bonfire night should take on new significance. we should burn effergys of whoever is EU president at that time
26/10/2017, 14:13:26: sil: is it Junker at mo?
26/10/2017, 14:14:05: Rich: Yeah
26/10/2017, 14:14:10: Rich: Jean Claude
26/10/2017, 14:14:36: Rich: I feel like we all know much more about European institutions than we did prior to brexit
26/10/2017, 14:15:16: sil: ha. yeah brexit has some how made everyone more involved in European politics

26/10/2017, 18:49:56: Alex Brown: Lad
26/10/2017, 18:50:16: Alex Brown: I discovered the perinaise the other day
26/10/2017, 18:50:45: Alex Brown: I had normal mayo with my scotch bonnet casserole
26/10/2017, 18:50:57: Alex Brown: I didnt dare add more chilli
26/10/2017, 18:51:30: Alex Brown: Try a bit when you get home james
26/10/2017, 18:51:43: Alex Brown: It will murder your mouth and ass
26/10/2017, 18:53:00: sil: Alex isn't the only mouth and ass murderer in town
26/10/2017, 18:53:05: sil: Lad

26/10/2017, 18:55:29: sil: James is a big fan of having his ass murdered
26/10/2017, 19:08:11: James: I would never harm an animal.
26/10/2017, 19:08:43: James: Unless it was delicious, and of suitably low intelligence.
26/10/2017, 19:12:36: Rich: Alex?
26/10/2017, 19:15:27: James: Are you suggesting Alex is delicious?
26/10/2017, 19:15:32: James: Gai

27/10/2017, 15:14:54: sil: expand my pallet
27/10/2017, 15:16:24: sil: don't wanna be scarred to drink anything above a particular shade of hay like rich
27/10/2017, 15:16:25: Rich: Is it next weekend?
27/10/2017, 15:16:51: sil: yeah, Saturday
27/10/2017, 15:18:30: Rich: Cool. We have Tash’s grandmas birthday in Pinner at lunch time but we’ll be there mid afternoon
27/10/2017, 15:18:37: Rich: Then we’re bottling on Sunday?
27/10/2017, 15:21:53: sil: I guess so
27/10/2017, 15:22:13: sil: if Alex is still up 4 it
27/10/2017, 15:26:06: Rich: Cool
27/10/2017, 15:26:17: Rich: I imagine he’ll be worse for wear but we should do it
27/10/2017, 15:26:32: Rich: I’ll check how the ciders looking when I get home tonight
27/10/2017, 15:31:40: sil: yeah. it's the only weekend I could do until the weekend of the 17th
27/10/2017, 16:01:02: Rich: Well we should do the bottling then either way
27/10/2017, 16:01:13: Rich: I’m keen to try what we bottled last time
27/10/2017, 16:03:36: Alex Brown: Yah mon
27/10/2017, 16:03:55: Alex Brown: Sunday evening of the 5th we bottle
27/10/2017, 16:04:05: sil: evening?
27/10/2017, 16:04:14: sil: I thought we'd be doing it through the day time
27/10/2017, 16:04:14: Alex Brown: If not we can rack again and bottle on the 17th
27/10/2017, 16:04:24: Alex Brown: My bro will be herr
27/10/2017, 16:04:38: Alex Brown: It will have to be like 5 onwarfs
27/10/2017, 16:04:40: sil: the whole point of doing at weekend was so we could do it leisurely and not rush
27/10/2017, 16:04:48: sil: well that's pointless then
27/10/2017, 16:04:56: Alex Brown: It wont take that long
27/10/2017, 16:05:02: sil: me and rich can start day time
27/10/2017, 16:05:07: Alex Brown: Why
27/10/2017, 16:05:18: Alex Brown: Are you doing something on the evening
27/10/2017, 16:05:35: Alex Brown: Im going for breakfast with my bro
27/10/2017, 16:05:36: sil: no, but the whole point was to make a day of it and chill and drink
27/10/2017, 16:05:41: Alex Brown: On the morning
27/10/2017, 16:05:51: Alex Brown: He usually goes earlyish
27/10/2017, 16:06:01: Rich: Yeah we’re doing it in the daytime
27/10/2017, 16:06:05: Rich: It’s going to take ages
27/10/2017, 16:06:23: Alex Brown: So i guess around 2-3 ill be over
27/10/2017, 16:06:28: Rich: I’d rather do it at a leisurely pace puntuated by cider breaks
27/10/2017, 16:06:29: Rich: Cool
27/10/2017, 16:06:36: sil: yeah that could work
27/10/2017, 16:06:42: Alex Brown: Sound
27/10/2017, 16:07:00: sil: I'll head over at 1ish and start peeping
27/10/2017, 16:07:03: sil: prepping
27/10/2017, 16:07:05: Rich: Cool
27/10/2017, 16:07:08: Alex Brown: Thats a more feasible time than starting in the morning after a beer fest
27/10/2017, 16:07:21: Rich: I might clean the bath and fill it with sterilant or something
27/10/2017, 16:07:28: Rich: Haha I don’t think we’d be starting in the morning
27/10/2017, 16:25:23: James: +1.
27/10/2017, 16:31:18: sil: yes james. we will venture into unknown territory together
27/10/2017, 16:31:26: James: Oatmeal stout can be very nice
27/10/2017, 16:31:43: Rich: Don’t listen to james! He liked trendy beer
27/10/2017, 16:31:49: Rich: Likes*
27/10/2017, 16:31:51: sil: I had an oatmeal beer that was really nice
27/10/2017, 16:31:56: James: Milk stout too, as long as they don't go too far overboard
27/10/2017, 16:32:30: sil: don't listen to rich. he thinks anything darker than MDF is a porter
27/10/2017, 16:33:27: James: I was going to suggest we go for broke and finish this beer fest an Imperial Stout @9%+
27/10/2017, 16:34:00: James: 🍺🍺🍺💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
27/10/2017, 16:36:30: James: I like all types of beer. I don't needlessly pigeon-hole myself in pursuit of some sort of redundant 'authenticity' agenda
27/10/2017, 16:36:57: James: 😆
27/10/2017, 16:51:37: Rich: That oatmeal beer was really nice. If only I could recall the name
27/10/2017, 16:54:48: sil: yeah same!
wasn't an oatmeal porter tho. was a pale. but good. like biscuity
27/10/2017, 16:54:57: sil: will take a pen this time
27/10/2017, 16:58:40: sil: https://stalbansbeerfestival.org.uk/beers
27/10/2017, 16:58:44: sil: let's find it
27/10/2017, 16:59:05: Rich: We shall
27/10/2017, 16:59:10: sil: it was patio bar
27/10/2017, 16:59:20: sil: found it
27/10/2017, 16:59:27: sil: Goat Oatmeal pale
27/10/2017, 16:59:33: Rich: Yeah that was it
27/10/2017, 16:59:36: sil: Animal brewery
27/10/2017, 16:59:53: James: Sounds trendy
27/10/2017, 17:00:23: James: And rich likes it
27/10/2017, 17:00:31: sil: http://www.xtbrewing.com/animal.html
27/10/2017, 17:00:43: James: Therefore rich is trendy

27/10/2017, 17:01:35: James: Trendy confirmed
27/10/2017, 17:01:37: sil: I like those labels
27/10/2017, 17:01:54: sil: there not London trendy hip graffiti tosh
27/10/2017, 17:02:13: Rich: +1

27/10/2017, 17:05:43: James: "The new aesthetic is asexual, inclusive and urban.."
27/10/2017, 17:05:48: James: Lul
27/10/2017, 17:06:01: James: Gonna enjoy reading that later
27/10/2017, 17:28:23: sil: I love trendy asexual beers
27/10/2017, 17:39:54: sil: mad squirrel, the stand in the stairwell
27/10/2017, 17:40:11: sil: they were pretty good beers.
what was the nice one from there?
27/10/2017, 17:49:25: sil: looking at the provisional beer list for watford. one of the brewerys is called "Dark Revolution" who only do dark beers
27/10/2017, 17:50:12: sil: they are serving "voodoo porter", which there website describes as a Smoked Chipotle Porter
27/10/2017, 17:50:36: sil: so intrigued. but perhaps that's jumping difficulty levels
27/10/2017, 17:54:29: James: Oh dear have we got to that stage already? New wave pale ale is already old hat and 'reimagined' dark beers are now the in thing...
27/10/2017, 17:55:08: sil: the revolution is coming James.
who's side are you gonna be on?
27/10/2017, 17:55:27: sil: it's all savoury porters from here
27/10/2017, 17:55:46: James: I never say never but provisional impression is 'not good'...
27/10/2017, 17:56:11: Rich: I’m waiting for a pale porter
27/10/2017, 17:56:18: James: Lul
27/10/2017, 17:56:57: sil: possibly probable?
colour doesn't dictate what the beer is
27/10/2017, 17:57:21: Rich: Just a really hoppy porter?
27/10/2017, 17:57:34: sil: you could infuse or slow roast hops on some way
27/10/2017, 17:57:38: Rich: I guess it would be dark because porters are defined by those roasted hops? I think?
27/10/2017, 17:57:37: James: I have seen a similar contradiction - it was that extra weak sailor ipa sil posted the other week
27/10/2017, 17:57:49: sil: porters are hoppy
27/10/2017, 17:57:49: James: With the mermaid tit brew
27/10/2017, 17:58:23: sil: what if some infuses the hops with oak smoke or something. so they don't burn?
27/10/2017, 17:58:49: James: Roasted malt
27/10/2017, 17:59:01: Rich: According to Wikipedia the definition of pale ale is that it’s made from pale malt so I guess it can’t exist
27/10/2017, 17:59:44: James: Pale ale uses pale malts by classification, porter/stout is roasted malts
27/10/2017, 17:59:48: Rich: Maybe if you dark roast the grain and then bleach it?
27/10/2017, 17:59:58: James: Snap
27/10/2017, 18:00:12: James: Lul
27/10/2017, 18:00:28: sil: still doesn't dictate colour
27/10/2017, 18:01:05: sil: let's get into brewing and create novelty paradoxical beers
27/10/2017, 18:01:23: James: Wasn't a response, just info
27/10/2017, 18:01:59: James: A lot if not all of the darker colour does come from roasting though
27/10/2017, 18:02:11: James: You could use additives
27/10/2017, 18:02:24: Rich: Let’s make Porter larger
27/10/2017, 18:02:37: Rich: Which I think is an actual possibility
27/10/2017, 18:02:50: Rich: Because you could dark roast the malt and then larger the beer
27/10/2017, 18:02:57: James: Roasted malt matured cold I guess?
27/10/2017, 18:03:05: James: Snap
27/10/2017, 18:03:27: sil: nice. let's do it
27/10/2017, 18:57:20: sil: https://youtu.be/mzAauyQBb9U
27/10/2017, 18:57:29: sil: everyone fav YouTube alcoholic

27/10/2017, 19:37:46: James: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 19:48:40: sil: wot. that's not a porter
27/10/2017, 19:48:55: sil: the brewery must have made a mistake
27/10/2017, 19:59:17: Alex Brown: Thats not a porter
27/10/2017, 20:03:50: sil: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 20:08:17: Alex Brown: Dark beer
27/10/2017, 20:08:22: Alex Brown: All shit
27/10/2017, 20:08:22: James: We should go to Jerusalem Tavern soon
27/10/2017, 20:08:31: sil: yeah man. it's a good pub
27/10/2017, 20:08:41: Alex Brown: Yeh like that pub
27/10/2017, 20:08:03: James: Niiiiice
27/10/2017, 20:08:45: Alex Brown: Cheap too
27/10/2017, 20:08:48: sil: the best in The City
27/10/2017, 20:09:00: James: You don't drink beer. Opinion not valid.
27/10/2017, 20:09:42: sil: it's funny how Alex and Rich think there the experts on beer when they are the most fussy drinkers
27/10/2017, 20:10:23: sil: Alex is also scared of anything darker than a wicker basket
27/10/2017, 20:11:00: sil: rich is about to mention I don't like wheat beer
27/10/2017, 20:11:05: Rich: You won’t drink German and Belgian beers your hypocrite
27/10/2017, 20:11:17: Rich: That’s not just wheat beer. That’s a huge variety of bees
27/10/2017, 20:11:24: Rich: 🐝
27/10/2017, 20:11:31: sil: bees are shit. they do nothing
27/10/2017, 20:12:04: sil: I drink Belgium beers when I'm in Europe. but its not a preference
27/10/2017, 20:12:47: sil: although I don't think i really know anything about Belgium beer.
and it was my suggestion to go to bruge!
27/10/2017, 20:18:30: Alex Brown: James is hating on the church
27/10/2017, 20:18:44: Alex Brown: James is being sold a church wedding
27/10/2017, 20:18:47: sil: what a fucking bro!
27/10/2017, 20:18:52: sil: fight the power
27/10/2017, 20:18:53: Alex Brown: He is denouncing god
27/10/2017, 20:18:57: Alex Brown: Scum
27/10/2017, 20:20:15: sil: it's people who blindly follow religion out of a sense of duty or tradition, outside of actual belief, that permit heinous and backwards thinking to creep into modern thought
27/10/2017, 20:21:17: sil: a muslim wouldn't get married in a synagogue. an atheist shouldn't get married in a church.
27/10/2017, 20:24:45: sil: getting married in a church outside of your belief is very much the same thing as ignoring sexual harassment because you feel it's non of your concern
27/10/2017, 20:45:03: sil: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 20:46:07: Rich: Haha
27/10/2017, 20:53:52: sil: this porter is nice.
chocolatey. quite rich. but more of a tartness that I wasn't expecting and so much more filling than I'm used to in a beer
27/10/2017, 20:54:12: sil: I feel like the ideal stout would have to be super sweet
27/10/2017, 20:57:23: James: Haha you're in luck. Lots of porters are very sweet, too sweet for me.
27/10/2017, 20:58:20: James: Milk stout sounds like a good option
27/10/2017, 20:58:54: sil: well this is a cream stout. which I assume is really the same thing?
27/10/2017, 20:59:29: sil: I'd say the only draw back is how filling it is
27/10/2017, 21:00:07: sil: especially if your drinking a whole bottle... at home....alone....
27/10/2017, 21:21:38: James: Milk stout has non fermentable lactose added, hence the sweetness. Not sure about cream.. assume it's similar?
27/10/2017, 21:22:19: James: Lul 😥

one of my colleges is gonna be at Watford beer fest who is a big stout and porter drinker. so he said he'll give me a tip on what is good there
27/10/2017, 21:23:19: James: Tripartite ceremony?
27/10/2017, 21:23:27: sil: what's the difference between stout and porter?
27/10/2017, 21:23:41: Alex Brown: Hope hes not asian
27/10/2017, 21:23:48: Alex Brown: You do hate asians
27/10/2017, 21:24:12: James: I think Porter is a general class of beet, whereas Stout is a particular type of porter
27/10/2017, 21:24:30: Alex Brown: I think james is a puss
27/10/2017, 21:24:47: James: Catty....

27/10/2017, 21:25:36: sil: let's see if it holds a flame to the superior southern ale
27/10/2017, 21:27:47: sil: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 21:28:20: sil: ok. first smell. I'm getting caramel hints
27/10/2017, 21:28:33: sil: not overly hoppy. not a bad thing
27/10/2017, 21:29:27: sil: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 21:29:44: sil: let's move onto the mouth feel and importantly the taste
27/10/2017, 21:29:55: James: Knob
27/10/2017, 21:29:57: James: Lol
27/10/2017, 21:30:07: James: Proceed....
27/10/2017, 21:30:40: James: Carbonation?
27/10/2017, 21:30:56: sil: wow. see I'm getting a medium carbonation here, it's livley but not fizzy
27/10/2017, 21:31:00: James: Malt flavour?
27/10/2017, 21:31:10: James: Oiliness?
27/10/2017, 21:31:24: James: Citrus notes?
27/10/2017, 21:31:49: James: Any old leather in there?
27/10/2017, 21:31:51: Alex Brown: Ha wedding venues

27/10/2017, 21:32:03: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
27/10/2017, 21:32:12: James: Or tobacco?
27/10/2017, 21:32:16: sil: no citrus, no malt. it's a very light hop with a light biter tone. very drinkable. very reasonable
27/10/2017, 21:32:19: James: +1
27/10/2017, 21:32:22: Alex Brown: Make the right choice james
27/10/2017, 21:33:07: sil: is Carrie going for church?
27/10/2017, 21:35:13: sil: don't give in
27/10/2017, 21:58:34: James: The malt in best and premium bitter tends to get overridden by the increased hops, which conversely feel slightly absent in regular bitters - but you get more malt in exchange. Swings and roundabouts I suppose...

29/10/2017, 20:07:08: Alex Brown: Well check it out
29/10/2017, 20:07:29: Alex Brown: Think its a bouldering specialised centre
29/10/2017, 20:07:42: Alex Brown: Up for going castle
29/10/2017, 20:07:52: Alex Brown: Trips just annoying
29/10/2017, 20:26:49: James: We went to the brownswood after climbing 👌🏻We should go again the next time we all go
29/10/2017, 20:27:41: sil: we go to the brownswood after every single climbing season
29/10/2017, 20:27:49: sil: session*
29/10/2017, 20:28:11: sil: looks like they've put up a big tent in the garden
29/10/2017, 20:29:43: Alex Brown: Yeh looks great in the garden
29/10/2017, 20:55:45: James: So do we
29/10/2017, 20:55:56: James: 😜
29/10/2017, 20:57:06: James: They have a beer called Timothy Taylors, it's very good.
29/10/2017, 20:57:32: sil: I think I drink a Timothy Taylor's after every single climbing session
29/10/2017, 20:58:21: sil: did you go for the landlord or the boltmaker?
29/10/2017, 20:59:28: James: So do I
29/10/2017, 20:59:49: James: Boltmaker
29/10/2017, 21:00:29: James: Very pleasant and balanced
29/10/2017, 21:06:51: James: Low carbonation, no head, less bitter than I expected from a best, malt flavour was not especially distinctive and was fairly subtle, a very good session beer overall. Wish I had another here at home to mull over it.
29/10/2017, 21:07:18: sil: stone the crowd
29/10/2017, 21:07:22: sil: crows
29/10/2017, 21:08:00: James: I would stone a single crow.

29/10/2017, 21:09:33: Alex Brown: He said it was good
29/10/2017, 21:09:57: sil: I always go for the landlord
29/10/2017, 21:10:30: Alex Brown: The boldering section of mile end looks pretty good actaully
29/10/2017, 21:10:52: sil: https://youtu.be/dySYXJ6slcQ
29/10/2017, 21:10:57: James: Its smaller but good fun
29/10/2017, 21:11:03: Alex Brown: Yeh
29/10/2017, 21:11:15: James: Most of the garden routes are fiendish
29/10/2017, 21:11:22: Alex Brown: The picture on the internet of mile end made it look boring
29/10/2017, 21:11:43: Alex Brown: Google pics look pretty interesting
29/10/2017, 21:11:47: sil: the castle is the best climbing centre in London
29/10/2017, 21:11:49: sil: Fact
29/10/2017, 21:11:52: Alex Brown: Yeh
29/10/2017, 21:12:01: Alex Brown: But you can try others
29/10/2017, 21:12:15: Alex Brown: You wont be cheating on it
29/10/2017, 21:12:24: sil: the castle also happens to be at the end of my road
29/10/2017, 21:12:27: Alex Brown: I guess you guys are members
29/10/2017, 21:12:38: Alex Brown: Well yeh but its far for me
29/10/2017, 21:12:41: James: Just difficult for us to get to
29/10/2017, 21:12:59: Alex Brown: Thats why im never arsed to come after work
29/10/2017, 21:13:15: Alex Brown: Just so badly connected
29/10/2017, 21:13:39: Alex Brown: That area also has very little in the way of stations
29/10/2017, 21:13:55: Alex Brown: I dont mind doing it on the weekend tho
29/10/2017, 21:14:31: Alex Brown: Membership there is like 400 a year

30/10/2017, 08:58:38: Rich: Also sometimes we drink Wandle after climbing
30/10/2017, 09:12:17: James: +1
30/10/2017, 09:14:36: James: Don't think I've tried Wandle. Didn't see it on tap yesterday
30/10/2017, 09:14:59: James: I dreamt a lucid dream about bouldering last night, the route was really cool.
30/10/2017, 09:15:04: Rich: It’s nice
30/10/2017, 09:15:41: Rich: I had a lucid dream about a specific feature of the Python programming language the other night...
30/10/2017, 09:19:33: sil: nerd
30/10/2017, 10:39:00: James: I'm booking Xmas leave today, anyone up for this?
30/10/2017, 10:47:11: sil: why Thursday and not Friday?
30/10/2017, 10:47:29: sil: going into work aftrer beer fest sounds not fun
30/10/2017, 10:49:08: James: I have a Christmas party on Friday
30/10/2017, 10:51:19: sil: ahh. I only have 1 half day left to book
30/10/2017, 10:51:28: sil: so can't do thurs
30/10/2017, 10:52:14: James: You can only do Fri then?
30/10/2017, 10:52:29: sil: well if I wanna do a half day, yeah
30/10/2017, 10:52:42: James: @447753461116 @447858386777 what days can you do?
30/10/2017, 10:53:50: James: We could go sat, but it shuts when beer runs out so we will probably have missed the best stuff earlier in the week
30/10/2017, 10:55:09: sil: hmmm. yeah. seeming as its a central London one I can see it being super busy at the weekend
30/10/2017, 10:56:51: sil: I could go on Thursday, but id have to be in work Friday. which would be hella lamr
30/10/2017, 11:09:01: James: Yes, this is an issue. Let's wait to hear from Rich/Alex
30/10/2017, 11:48:44: Rich: Erm I guess I could come for a bit Thursday
30/10/2017, 11:48:47: Rich: What was the date?
30/10/2017, 11:49:31: sil: this one isn't free for camra members btw rich
30/10/2017, 11:49:44: sil: cause it's in Hackney
30/10/2017, 11:50:45: James: Thur 7th Dec. Can you do Friday?
30/10/2017, 11:51:29: Rich: What CAMRA benefit does it afford us?
30/10/2017, 11:51:37: Rich: It’s in the diary
30/10/2017, 11:51:48: sil: £3 for members
30/10/2017, 11:51:50: James: £3 entry instead of £5
30/10/2017, 11:51:55: Rich: I may just come after work depending
30/10/2017, 11:52:12: Rich: What a saving! Do we get additional complementary beer tokens?
30/10/2017, 11:52:23: sil: yeah i could nip in Thursday. but can't make proper day of it which is shame
30/10/2017, 11:54:01: Rich: I’m not sure how many afternoon and evening beer festivals I can handle in one season
30/10/2017, 11:54:28: sil: revoke this man's membership!
30/10/2017, 11:54:35: James: If everyone can do half day Friday i can sack off the Xmas party (contractor event)
30/10/2017, 11:56:02: James: +2
30/10/2017, 11:57:24: James: Camra notified, beards on way to rescind membership.
30/10/2017, 12:13:48: sil: I could do Friday. but don't sack of a work event just for a camra beer fest (however just that might be)
30/10/2017, 12:14:03: sil: might be another event that crops up that works for everyone
30/10/2017, 12:20:18: James: It's only a builder we work with occasionally, so not a big deal. In any case it sounds like Thur evening is currently the best bet?
30/10/2017, 12:22:38: sil: yeah, itl have to be a relatively light one tho.
although for £3 entry I'll have to get atleast 4 pints
30/10/2017, 12:25:37: James: Cool cool. Just @447753461116 to confirm then.
30/10/2017, 12:26:16: Rich: Yeah I’d happily grab a couple of pints after work
30/10/2017, 12:29:30: sil: I do have a half day left to take off for the year.
so I'm up for taking a half day for some other lads lads lads drinking event around Christmas if you spot anything worth taking the time for on a Friday
30/10/2017, 14:59:38: Alex Brown: Been to the wandle pub before
30/10/2017, 15:00:09: Alex Brown: Yhe 7th dec im game
30/10/2017, 15:00:17: Alex Brown: Ill book a half day
30/10/2017, 15:03:37: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 15:16:29: sil: so just you and James doing half day then?
30/10/2017, 15:16:56: sil: who's this pussy handed amateur?
30/10/2017, 15:17:30: sil: looks like some rookie didnt chalk up
30/10/2017, 15:17:46: Rich: what a lamewad
30/10/2017, 15:47:20: sil: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 15:54:06: sil: looks like we've been doing cycling wrong
30/10/2017, 16:00:47: Rich: Cycling usually gets me on drugs
30/10/2017, 21:23:45: James: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 21:30:00: James: Interesting beer.
30/10/2017, 21:34:28: sil: black Indian "pale?" Ale
30/10/2017, 21:35:41: James: Very dark colour, medium carbonation, strong and complex roasted malt flavours, strong ipa level hops and bitterness, the two work surprisingly  well together, mouthfeel smooth and velvety with a clean finish.
30/10/2017, 21:35:59: sil: that fales on being an IPA on 2 account. 1 it's not pale and 2 its pretty weak for an ipa at 4.6
30/10/2017, 21:36:06: James: Stone 1 and a half crows
30/10/2017, 21:37:18: Alex Brown: True
30/10/2017, 21:37:25: Alex Brown: Bogus IPA
30/10/2017, 21:37:30: Alex Brown: Not pale
30/10/2017, 21:38:16: sil: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 21:38:59: James: 1) beer colour doesn't dictate style, 2) it's not an IPA it's a 'black ipa', 3) IPAs are 4% abv upwards.
30/10/2017, 21:39:42: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 21:39:44: sil: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 21:39:53: Alex Brown: Look at those weak hands
30/10/2017, 21:40:05: sil: who is this rookie?
30/10/2017, 21:40:20: James: Source?
30/10/2017, 21:40:25: sil: you don't climb without chalk
30/10/2017, 21:40:37: Alex Brown: Yeh I had no chalk
30/10/2017, 21:40:42: sil: that's the first rule of climbing
30/10/2017, 21:40:44: Alex Brown: Thats the next step
30/10/2017, 21:41:02: Alex Brown: We never used chalk when we started sil
30/10/2017, 21:41:14: sil: you probably didn't
30/10/2017, 21:41:19: sil: I did
30/10/2017, 21:41:24: Alex Brown: You definitely didnt
30/10/2017, 21:41:26: sil: i probably snook it in

30/10/2017, 21:41:37: Alex Brown: Sure
30/10/2017, 21:41:37: sil: and used it without you noticing
30/10/2017, 21:41:53: sil: I've literally never been a rookie
30/10/2017, 21:42:15: sil: I was born climbing.
I climbing out the womb. covered in chalk
30/10/2017, 21:42:15: Alex Brown: Sure
30/10/2017, 21:42:27: Alex Brown: I saw an easy run beat you
30/10/2017, 21:42:30: Alex Brown: Puss
30/10/2017, 21:42:45: sil: I texted Adam if he wanted to come Watford beer fest. no reply

30/10/2017, 21:42:55: sil: text him and force him out
30/10/2017, 21:43:07: Alex Brown: He tried to come climbing
30/10/2017, 21:43:21: Alex Brown: He waited for 45 minutes for us
30/10/2017, 21:43:33: Alex Brown: And we searched around the entire place
30/10/2017, 21:43:39: Alex Brown: Then he left
30/10/2017, 21:43:53: Alex Brown: We later realised there are two buildings
30/10/2017, 21:44:00: sil: I thought he was with rich at the seaside that day
30/10/2017, 21:44:09: Alex Brown: About 3 minutes walk up the road
30/10/2017, 21:44:29: Alex Brown: Wierd place
30/10/2017, 21:44:32: James: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 21:44:37: Alex Brown: Was good tho
30/10/2017, 21:44:40: sil: there are 2 climbing buildings?
30/10/2017, 21:44:44: sil: that's not true?
30/10/2017, 21:44:50: Alex Brown: All bouldering
30/10/2017, 21:45:00: sil: are you talking about the castle?
30/10/2017, 21:45:05: Alex Brown: Two sections to the arch
30/10/2017, 21:45:20: Alex Brown: Building one and the biscuit factory
30/10/2017, 21:45:32: sil: oh right.

30/10/2017, 21:45:33: Alex Brown: I quite enjoyed it but it was packed
30/10/2017, 21:45:51: Alex Brown: No me and james went to arch after work today
30/10/2017, 21:45:55: Alex Brown: Adam came
30/10/2017, 21:46:02: Alex Brown: But we missed him
30/10/2017, 21:46:22: Alex Brown: As neither of us realised there were two separate buildings
30/10/2017, 21:46:23: sil: we went to the castle today and it was very nice and quiet
30/10/2017, 21:46:41: Alex Brown: Worth trying tho they had some hard as nails bit
30/10/2017, 21:47:02: James: Arch = pro mode.
30/10/2017, 21:47:02: Alex Brown: They have a tunnel which as nostly upside down routes
30/10/2017, 21:47:11: James: Not for novices.
30/10/2017, 21:47:19: James: Keep to the castle
30/10/2017, 21:47:27: sil: what you guys doing there then?
30/10/2017, 21:47:34: Alex Brown: Castles better of course but its got great higher level stuff
30/10/2017, 21:47:42: Alex Brown: You shouldnt go sil
30/10/2017, 21:48:00: Alex Brown: You might be laughed
30/10/2017, 21:48:23: James: Probably wouldn't let him in
30/10/2017, 21:49:12: sil: did you have chalk today Alex?
30/10/2017, 21:49:18: James: For real men who push until they blister. Not chalk using trendies

30/10/2017, 21:49:49: Alex Brown: Chalk is for soft hands pussied
30/10/2017, 21:49:50: sil: you will do permanent damage to your hands

30/10/2017, 21:51:12: sil: everyone will know your the guys who didn t chalk up
30/10/2017, 21:51:49: James: Reputation as a puss. Yes need to damage that until broken and replaced with lad rep.
30/10/2017, 21:51:52: James: 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
30/10/2017, 21:52:00: sil: does everyone look at you with your blistered hands, grappling with whatever colour you fancy, the  jumping off at the top, and laugh?
30/10/2017, 21:53:11: sil: in the castle. we bully begginers.
we have this bell we ring whenever someone uses the beginners colours or someone doent start with both hands on the grade number. we ring the bell and shame them home
30/10/2017, 21:57:02: James: I have my own climbing shoes. Everyone at castle will know you are noob next to me. You can fetch me latte and I might give you tips.
30/10/2017, 21:58:00: James: Will be assumed you are in my private lesson
30/10/2017, 21:58:29: sil: latte?

30/10/2017, 21:59:20: James: I got a fuckin roasting for asking for soy milk.. jesus...
30/10/2017, 21:59:25: sil: try ordering a coffee at the castle. they will mark your hands and commit you to the polka dot routes only
30/10/2017, 21:59:36: James: Guy almost ripped my head off
30/10/2017, 22:00:03: sil: I would have thought soy was pretty standard at a climbing centre
30/10/2017, 22:00:13: sil: there all mountain hippies
30/10/2017, 22:00:19: James: Noob noob noob
30/10/2017, 22:00:35: James: Soy is *baaaaad* apparently
30/10/2017, 22:00:49: sil: it does have palm oil or something
30/10/2017, 22:00:57: sil: something regarding deforestation
30/10/2017, 22:01:02: sil: the soy itself I guess
30/10/2017, 22:01:13: James: Got a friggin lecture on deforestation, when I refused oat milk
30/10/2017, 22:01:18: James: Snap
30/10/2017, 22:01:51: sil: I'm no noob James.
I know the climbing communities environmental concerns
30/10/2017, 22:02:10: James: Bet that shit has some major downsides too..
30/10/2017, 22:02:33: James: Apparently not. Soy is frowned upon.
30/10/2017, 22:02:38: James: Heavily.
30/10/2017, 22:03:29: sil: well I knew it was frowned upon because of little baby pussy forests. but I didn t know how much hippies cared
30/10/2017, 22:03:53: Alex Brown: Ha your no climbee
30/10/2017, 22:03:56: James: Climbing is very vegan....
30/10/2017, 22:04:04: sil: if forests were all that great they wouldn't be so easy to cut down in the first place
30/10/2017, 22:04:13: Alex Brown: You dont eat enough bean curds
30/10/2017, 22:04:14: James: Which is ironic given the muscular strength involved
30/10/2017, 22:04:27: Alex Brown: Good point
30/10/2017, 22:04:48: sil: it's true. us climbers are very muscular and good looking
30/10/2017, 22:05:12: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
30/10/2017, 22:05:19: James: You're not climber. You don't have topknot.

05/11/2017, 18:01:56: sil: 81
05/11/2017, 18:02:18: Alex Brown: Shall we get a co2 cannister for that barrel?
05/11/2017, 19:10:14: Rich: Could do: we haven’t put sugar in. But it is very dull
05/11/2017, 19:10:15: Rich: Full
05/11/2017, 19:10:43: Alex Brown: Yeh just makes it easier to poor
05/11/2017, 19:15:42: sil: truev
05/11/2017, 19:15:50: sil: good point
05/11/2017, 19:16:16: sil: I forget it just dribbles slow about halfway through
05/11/2017, 19:24:39: Rich: Oh right yeah we should

05/11/2017, 19:44:41: Alex Brown: Yeh its an annoying trickle without
05/11/2017, 19:46:42: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
05/11/2017, 19:46:52: Alex Brown: Sure you can get cheaper ones
05/11/2017, 19:47:03: Alex Brown: But yeh its like 7 to refil
05/11/2017, 19:47:49: Alex Brown: Alternatively get on of those
05/11/2017, 19:47:54: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
05/11/2017, 19:48:17: Alex Brown: With creamer sized cannisters
05/11/2017, 19:48:40: Alex Brown: But then you have to keep filling as you go
05/11/2017, 19:49:42: Alex Brown: <‎image omitted>
05/11/2017, 19:50:22: Rich: Not really worth it for 50 pints
06/11/2017, 08:42:31: James: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 08:45:06: Rich: Lol

06/11/2017, 09:57:45: James: You guys all up for The Ivy House for that folk night on Thur?
06/11/2017, 09:58:49: James: The one I mentioned last month - real ale, nice venue, chance to play if you fancy it, etc. etc.
06/11/2017, 10:01:48: Rich: Yeah could do
06/11/2017, 10:01:52: Rich: It’s damn far from Walthamstow
06/11/2017, 10:14:03: sil: I happen to be away again that day!
06/11/2017, 10:45:41: James: Oh dear.. perhaps next month...
06/11/2017, 10:47:26: James: We'll be there at around 730 on Thur in any case if anyone can make it.
06/11/2017, 10:48:48: Rich: Yeah may well do
06/11/2017, 10:49:01: Rich: I guess I can cycle to Liverpool Street and get the train afterwards
06/11/2017, 10:49:01: James: It's always second Thursday of the no so hopefully we'll find a suitable date soon. @447858386777 Let me know about the other one you mentioned before if you fancy it.
06/11/2017, 10:49:16: Rich: Yeah I think that’s every week or two
06/11/2017, 10:52:38: James: Cool, that would good. I've invited Adam and Kirsty (they came to the last one), but haven't heard back yet. Nicola seemed keen so hopefully we'll have a few peeps going. Beer selection was really good last time.
06/11/2017, 10:55:14: Rich: You guys all about weekend after next for cider drinking?
06/11/2017, 11:01:28: sil: yeah. but don't wanna play a very long board game
06/11/2017, 11:01:37: Rich: Yeah neither do I
06/11/2017, 11:01:48: Rich: I did say but Zakk doesn’t take hints easily
06/11/2017, 11:03:32: sil: zakk can be a determined man
06/11/2017, 11:09:37: James: Hmm I think me and Carrie will be in Beccles (about 3miles from Southwold). If not that would be good 🍎🥃🤤
06/11/2017, 11:35:07: Rich: Ok. Well if alex is about I reckon we should do weekend after next
06/11/2017, 11:35:36: Rich: We can put the barrel on the coffee table so people can top up without getting up
06/11/2017, 11:36:39: sil: sure.

06/11/2017, 13:14:32: sil: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 13:15:27: sil: looks like they're a bunch of tax dodgin', troop hatin' , flag burning, commie scum bags. 

Sad.
06/11/2017, 13:59:05: Alex Brown: Weekend after next is dudley beer fest no?
06/11/2017, 13:59:05: Alex Brown: 25th
06/11/2017, 13:59:26: Rich: No it’s the 17th
06/11/2017, 13:59:27: Alex Brown: Oh no 18th im game
06/11/2017, 13:59:30: Alex Brown: Yeh
06/11/2017, 13:59:33: Alex Brown: Sound
06/11/2017, 13:59:37: Rich: Wanna do Friday or Saturday?
06/11/2017, 14:00:17: Alex Brown: Im free for both
06/11/2017, 14:00:32: Alex Brown: We can drink out on the friday if zakks here
06/11/2017, 14:00:56: Rich: He’s not I think we got wires crossed
06/11/2017, 14:01:03: Rich: I’ll say Saturday
06/11/2017, 14:01:16: Alex Brown: Tend to get more time to chill on a sat
06/11/2017, 14:01:21: Rich: Yeah
06/11/2017, 14:01:42: Rich: I’ll get a few people round and stick the barrel in the living room
06/11/2017, 14:01:55: Alex Brown: Yah mon
06/11/2017, 14:07:02: sil: yeah let's do sat afternoon
06/11/2017, 14:07:14: sil: make a day of it
06/11/2017, 14:09:37: Rich: Ok I’ll say 3pm?
06/11/2017, 14:14:24: sil: nah.
say 2.55
06/11/2017, 14:14:35: Rich: Fuck it’s too late now
06/11/2017, 14:14:46: Rich: That was silly. I can’t believe I didn’t think to do that
06/11/2017, 14:20:18: sil: idiot.
won't be able to come now
06/11/2017, 14:20:21: sil: 3 is too late
06/11/2017, 14:20:44: sil: guess I could try and move a few things aroudnb
06/11/2017, 14:22:48: Rich: If you could. I assume people have already read the invite and planned their weeks around the specific start time by his point
06/11/2017, 14:24:09: sil: is zakk gonna come down?
06/11/2017, 14:24:23: Rich: He’s in Swansea that weekend
06/11/2017, 14:24:40: sil: thats a shame
06/11/2017, 14:26:34: sil: if you clear your fridge, maybe put everything on one shelf, reckon you'd be able to put the barrel in there?
06/11/2017, 14:26:54: Rich: Doesn’t look likely
06/11/2017, 14:27:12: Rich: It should be chilled from being in the basement and would take a long time to warm up
06/11/2017, 14:27:37: sil: true.
just wondered.
06/11/2017, 14:28:05: Rich: Also it would be nice to have it in the living room so we can refill as we go
06/11/2017, 14:28:11: sil: we could get a long pipe and pressure cannister and keep the barrel in the basement and fill up in the living room
06/11/2017, 14:28:19: Rich: There must be like 50 pints in that barrel
06/11/2017, 14:28:40: Rich: Haha. We need a proper pull tap
06/11/2017, 14:28:58: sil: could use a garden hose with a trigger
06/11/2017, 14:29:09: sil: woldnt be very hygienic
06/11/2017, 14:29:12: Rich: I do have one
06/11/2017, 14:29:18: Rich: It would probably make it taste weird
06/11/2017, 14:32:05: sil: we should get a C02 canisters tho
06/11/2017, 14:32:12: sil: don't think they cost lots
06/11/2017, 14:33:33: Rich: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Generic-Unisex-GENC1220-Capsules-Silver/dp/B00N94JGZ4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1509978781&sr=8-3&keywords=co2

£10
06/11/2017, 14:33:45: Rich: someone else can order those as I've bought a lot of stuff for the cider lately
06/11/2017, 15:04:24: sil: this boardgame seems to really have taken hold of the bridgnorth group
06/11/2017, 15:04:53: sil: think I'll wait for them to lose interest before visiting home
06/11/2017, 15:05:19: Rich: They’ve just bought like 5 expansions for it
06/11/2017, 15:05:31: Rich: I fully expect they’ll be playing it in Scotland
06/11/2017, 15:05:46: sil: is it like a super long one that takes hours?
06/11/2017, 15:05:59: Rich: Yeah apparently it’s fairly epic
06/11/2017, 15:06:05: Rich: Dungeons and dragons on a board
06/11/2017, 15:08:06: James: Which boardgame is it?
06/11/2017, 15:08:25: Rich: Talisman
06/11/2017, 15:08:34: James: My sister's fiancé made us play long, convoluted, niche, expandable nerd board games in Scotland last year - I'm not doing that again..
06/11/2017, 15:09:50: James: Sounds boring
06/11/2017, 15:10:38: Rich: Don’t worry there will be other activities to choose from including hillwalking and drinking heavily
06/11/2017, 15:11:02: James: Perhaps drink and/or drugs could be worked into the core gameplay to liven it up?
06/11/2017, 15:13:07: sil: knowing our friends, there will be regular spliff breaks
06/11/2017, 15:45:52: sil: <‎GIF omitted>
06/11/2017, 16:29:02: sil: @447792421618 I found a porter ive highlighted as my favourite dark beer of the festival
06/11/2017, 16:30:39: sil: I've now identified what i like in a porter. I like the more sweeter more fruity porters over the heavy chocolatey ones
06/11/2017, 16:30:41: James: I do not intend to break. I am multitasker
06/11/2017, 16:31:53: James: Intriguing, which beer?
06/11/2017, 16:33:33: James: ELB do a 3 year vintage porter (10%), that according to the guy in the shop has similar consistency to balsamic vinegar.... From what you've said above you probably wouldn't like it lol
06/11/2017, 16:34:00: Rich: Sounds awful
06/11/2017, 16:34:21: sil: this will make Rich winse. but it's called "Urban Fox" by slightly foxed brewery
06/11/2017, 16:34:37: James: It does sound a tad heavy... Even by porter standards...
06/11/2017, 16:34:50: sil: ew. vinegar?
that the opposite of what I like in a porter.
06/11/2017, 16:35:09: Rich: Vinegar is the opposite of good alcohol
06/11/2017, 16:35:13: James: Consistency, I don't think the flavour is similar
06/11/2017, 16:36:13: James: So Trrreeendy... Please tell me it has a graffiti label?
06/11/2017, 16:47:48: James: Interesting, I think I prefer the more bitter porters I've had recently, the sweet ones I've had have been way too sweet. Not sure about whether I prefer fruity or chocolatey more yet but very heavy porters are generally a bit much.
06/11/2017, 16:49:06: sil: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 16:49:19: sil: here's the description of the one I identified as my fav
06/11/2017, 16:50:08: James: Yeah was just reading that, sounds nice. The winter ale sounds good too.
06/11/2017, 16:51:13: sil: the fruit notes made it more palatable than just the heavy chocolatey tones.
06/11/2017, 16:53:45: sil: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 16:54:03: Rich: Mm that one was nice
06/11/2017, 16:54:12: Rich: Subtle vanilla tones
06/11/2017, 16:54:18: Rich: A little like bathams
06/11/2017, 16:54:37: sil: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 16:55:24: sil: thatd the smooth bitter after taste!
06/11/2017, 16:56:17: Rich: Certainly
06/11/2017, 17:58:07: Alex Brown: Half a standard barrel innet
06/11/2017, 17:58:20: Alex Brown: What 36 pints?
06/11/2017, 20:53:30: sil: <‎image omitted>
06/11/2017, 20:53:43: sil: I reckon the left 1 is 2x better
06/11/2017, 20:53:54: sil: but the right one is 5x
06/11/2017, 21:27:18: James: The peanut butter milk stout tastes pretty repulsive so -100x better than bathams. Haven't had the grapefruit, probably much nicer than bathams
06/11/2017, 21:28:11: sil: is -100x better than bathams actually better than bathams, or just as good?
06/11/2017, 21:35:44: James: <‎image omitted>

06/11/2017, 21:40:52: Rich: I hope so
06/11/2017, 21:41:07: Rich: Is this Gordon Ramsey on cocaine?
06/11/2017, 21:41:12: Rich: They’re all at it these days
06/11/2017, 21:41:21: Rich: I heard Sue Perkins is on gange
06/11/2017, 21:44:31: Alex Brown: Gordon Ramsay is like a grissley crocadile penis
06/11/2017, 21:46:27: Alex Brown: Fuck he makes good looking steak tho
06/11/2017, 21:47:07: Alex Brown: All of his recipes are mainly butter
06/11/2017, 21:48:37: sil: that's his daughter
06/11/2017, 21:49:48: Alex Brown: I know

07/11/2017, 13:25:54: sil: before going to a pub before to check the what pub website and check put the features tab to discover our privileges
07/11/2017, 13:26:16: sil: that was an awful sentence
07/11/2017, 13:26:33: Alex Brown: Sounds like a scam
07/11/2017, 13:26:41: sil: haha
07/11/2017, 13:27:03: sil: all I meant to say. is the what pub magazine informs us of our member privileges at any pub
07/11/2017, 13:43:55: James: Cool, think there's an app for that but i think you have to pay a subscription or something.
07/11/2017, 13:46:22: James: I've been looking for a pub with a good cask porter/stout selection but they don't seem to exist - not popular enough I suppose. I think a pub with a huge bottle range is next best bet.
07/11/2017, 13:47:13: James: Shame you can't sample that way though
07/11/2017, 13:48:25: Alex Brown: Thats because good porters and stouts dont exist
07/11/2017, 13:49:00: sil: open your mind
07/11/2017, 13:50:34: sil: what are your parents doing in town on a Tuesday rich?
07/11/2017, 13:52:13: James: *eyes. I said a good selection.

07/11/2017, 14:02:19: Rich: They’re just down for the night to go for a meal
07/11/2017, 14:03:24: James: Nice. Which squat will they be dining in?
07/11/2017, 14:06:40: sil: <‎image omitted>
07/11/2017, 14:07:20: James: Lul
07/11/2017, 14:07:28: James: Still a mad sesh
07/11/2017, 14:08:04: Rich: Took me a while to cotton on...
07/11/2017, 14:08:38: James: That joke's grasping at threads...
07/11/2017, 14:08:49: sil: I still think it's a picture of a mad sesh tbf. they can't pull the wool over my eyes
07/11/2017, 14:09:45: James: Where was pic taken -looks like Fabric?
07/11/2017, 14:10:45: sil: Pretty sure its a live show. who were the band who played "Cotton Eyed joe"?
07/11/2017, 14:11:14: James: Looks more like a string quartet
07/11/2017, 14:11:49: sil: really?
you must be blind. think you need to test your field of vision mate
07/11/2017, 14:12:10: James: Was only spinning you a yarn...
07/11/2017, 14:13:02: sil: this thread is wearing pretty thin....
07/11/2017, 14:13:58: Rich: Get Stein beck to work
07/11/2017, 14:14:21: sil: that's pretty awful. you just killed it. well done
07/11/2017, 14:14:33: Rich: Thanks
07/11/2017, 14:14:47: Rich: I knew it would dust bowl you over.
07/11/2017, 14:22:16: James: I think weave exhausted the puns here...
07/11/2017, 14:24:11: sil: took him a long time. but the quality punnage has returned
07/11/2017, 20:53:13: James: <‎image omitted>
07/11/2017, 21:07:40: sil: I saw that.
tempted to get the trail runs for all those beer company's
07/11/2017, 21:07:58: sil: they all do an introduction offer. so might just try them all
07/11/2017, 21:08:04: sil: but never subscribe
07/11/2017, 21:34:17: James: Stick it to the man
07/11/2017, 22:59:33: James: <‎image omitted>
07/11/2017, 23:00:22: sil: that does sound like the description id like
07/11/2017, 23:00:57: sil: have you had it?
08/11/2017, 07:26:58: James: I had their premium bitter last night - it was very good.
08/11/2017, 08:29:37: James: They're based in Wiltshire and have five pubs. Bit more research needed, but if the pubs look like they are worth visiting these could potentially be worked into a future Gloucestershire/Wiltshire Tour if the route passed nearby.
08/11/2017, 08:34:45: sil: very interesting
08/11/2017, 08:44:34: James: http://molesbrewingco.co.uk/core-ales/
08/11/2017, 08:49:12: James: They do a craft range so they'll be something for @447858386777 too: http://molesbrewingco.co.uk/craft-ales/
